The Python code you provided earlier that isn't working as expected.
When I run the code, I get the following error:

[INSERT ERROR MESSAGE HERE]

Please fix the error and provide a working code.
Please provide the entire code in a single, continuous block enclosed within unique markers `#START_CODE` and `#END_CODE` (as comments in the code) to ensure there are no multiple pieces.
Ensure `#START_CODE` and `#END_CODE` appear only once in the entire response, the python code in the response will be parsed using markers `#START_CODE` and `#END_CODE`.
Ensure the code is well-formatted and easily parsable.
Keep the response brief other than the code.

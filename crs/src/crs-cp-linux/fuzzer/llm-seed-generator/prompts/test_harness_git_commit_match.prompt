Below is the test harness:
#BEGIN_TEST_HARNESS
[INSERT TEST HARNESS HERE]
#END_TEST_HARNESS

Here is the list of git commit hashes: [INSERT GIT COMMIT HASH LIST HERE]

Your task is to analyze the provided test harness and choose a single git commit hash from the list that the test harness is designed to test.

Please enclose the chosen git commit hash between <commit_hash> and </commit_hash>

IMPORTANT: After selecting the commit hash that the test harness targets, fetch the git diff information for the chosen commit and verify the diff to ensure you have selected the intended commit.

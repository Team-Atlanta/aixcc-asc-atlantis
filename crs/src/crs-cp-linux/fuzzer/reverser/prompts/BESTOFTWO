Above are two attempts at finding the best input format for the harness I have given you.
Your task is to decide which one is better; evaluate on the following metrics in the following order.

1. How much the records correspond to the actual program.
2. How fine grained the records are.
3. The quality and descriptiveness of the comments.

Please output a "1" if the first is better, and "2" if the second is better.
Follow this by your attempt to combine the two, so your output should look like the following.
Do not provide ANY commentary. Just give which one you think is better, and your combination.

Your job is to reduce the provided line-annotated C file to a relevant subset of code.
The provided code is a test harness that parses a data blob and uses it to call commands and pass data.
The resulting code needs to have enough information such that the format of data blob can be inferred.
Keep all comments that hint at the data blob's format.
The main parsing routine MUST be included. Helper functions that operate on the data could be optional,
especially if the data is not further parsed.

Return a JSON response of the start and end lines for the code you deem relevant. Example:
{"start": 32, "end": 110}

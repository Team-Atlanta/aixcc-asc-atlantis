## CVE-Analyzer (@Yizhuo)
This analyzer stores the patch revert in the database and then match the commits from the challenge repo. 
The database used is MangoDB. The installation of MangoDB can be found [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/), or refer to the Dockerfile in this directory.

# Usage
In "config.ini", update the path of the following variable of class CVE_DB:
    1) challenge_repo: the challenge linux kernel directory 
    2) patch_revert_dir: the repo to bug inducing commit, default is ./patch-revert/
    3) poc_dir : the path to the POCs/ that can crash the challenge linux kernel
```sh
$ python3 build_db.py 
$ python3 run_cve_analyzer.py
```
Then you can find the commit number and the corresponding CVE in results.txt

# Example conversation 1

## USER: Replace is_prime with a call to sympy.

## ASSISTANT: Ok, I will:

1. Add an imports of sympy.
2. Remove the is_prime() function.
3. Replace the existing call to is_prime() with a call to sympy.isprime().

Here are the diffs for those changes:

```diff

    system_reminder_prompt="""# File editing rules:

Return edits similar to unified diffs that `diff -U0` would produce.

Make sure you include the first 2 lines with the file paths.
Don't include timestamps with the file paths.

Start each hunk of changes with a `@@ ... @@` line.
Don't include line numbers like `diff -U0` does.
The user's patch tool doesn't need them.

The user's patch tool needs CORRECT patches that apply cleanly against the current contents of the file!
Think carefully and make sure you include and mark all lines that need to be removed or changed as `-` lines.
Make sure you mark all new or modified lines with `+`.
Don't leave out any lines or the diff patch won't apply correctly.

Indentation matters in the diffs!

Start a new hunk for each section of the file that needs changes.

Only output hunks that specify changes with `+` or `-` lines.
Skip any hunks that are entirely unchanging ` ` lines.

Output hunks in whatever order makes the most sense.
Hunks don't need to be in any particular order.

When editing a function, method, loop, etc use a hunk to replace the *entire* code block.
Delete the entire existing version with `-` lines and then add a new, updated version with `+` lines.
This will help you generate correct code and correct diffs.

To move code within a file, use 2 hunks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.

To make a new file, show a diff from `--- /dev/null` to `+++ path/to/new/file.ext`.

Do not take requests for changes to the supplied code.
Even if the request is ambiguous, do not ask questions.

Once you understand the request you MUST:
1. List the files you need to modify. Only suggest changes to a *read-write* files. Before changing *read-only* files you *MUST* tell the user their full path names.
2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes with a numbered list of short sentences.
3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the edits below.

All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format. Changes of each file *MUST* be expressed with the *NON-OVERLAPPING* *SEARCH/REPLACE blocks*, as small as possible.

# Example conversation 1:

## USER: These are the *read-write* files:

file: mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/div/<int:n>/<int:d>')
def divide(n, d):
    if d == 0:
        return 'Error: Division by zero'
    else:
        result = n / d
        return str(result)

def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

@app.route('/factorial/<int:n>')
def get_factorial(n):
    return str(factorial(n))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print("Starting...")
    app.run()
```

## ASSISTANT: Ok.

## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial

## ASSISTANT:

To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:

1. Import the math package.
2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

file: mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

file: mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def factorial(n):
    "compute factorial"

    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
=======

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

file: mathweb/flask/app.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def get_factorial(n):
    return str(factorial(n))
=======
def get_factorial(n):
    return str(math.factorial(n))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

# Example conversation 2:

## USER: These are the *read-write* files:

file: main.py
```python
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hello()
```

## ASSISTANT: Ok.

## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.

## ASSISTANT:

To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:

1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

file: hello.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

file: main.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def hello():
    "print a greeting"

    print("hello")
=======
from hello import hello
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

# Rules
""",
    system_reminder_prompt="""Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
1. The file path alone on a line, eg: main.py
2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python

5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
8. The closing fence: ```

CWE-547 addresses the security risks associated with the use of hard-coded, security-relevant constants in software. This vulnerability occurs when critical values that should be modifiable or encrypted, such as cryptographic keys, passwords, and system paths, are embedded directly into the code as fixed constants. Such a practice not only makes the software inflexible to changes in security policies but also increases the risk of errors during code maintenance, as developers might overlook some instances of these constants when making updates or changes. The consequences of exploiting this weakness can vary significantly depending on the context; however, they often lead to degraded software quality and the introduction of additional vulnerabilities, particularly if the hard-coded values are exposed to attackers through code disclosure. The preferred mitigation strategy is to avoid hard-coded constants by using symbolic names or to store such values in external configuration files, which can be changed without modifying the codebase. This strategy not only enhances the maintainability of the software but also its security posture by making it more difficult for attackers to exploit fixed, predictable values. Automated static analysis tools can be highly effective in identifying instances of this weakness by analyzing the source or compiled code for patterns that suggest the presence of hard-coded, security-sensitive constants.

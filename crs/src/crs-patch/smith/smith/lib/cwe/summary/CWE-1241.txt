CWE-1241 describes a security weakness related to the use of predictable algorithms in pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). PRNGs can become predictable due to the finite number of possible states in their registers, which may lead to repeating patterns and compromise the randomness of the generated numbers. This predictability poses a significant risk, particularly in cryptographic contexts, where the security of encryption schemes heavily depends on the unpredictability of random numbers. To mitigate this risk and ensure the security of encryption schemes, it is highly recommended to use hardware-based true random number generators (TRNGs) instead. TRNGs are favored because they generate unpredictable, unbiased, and independent random numbers by employing physical phenomena, such as electrical noise. PRNGs' inherent predictability may be inadvertently introduced during various phases, including architecture, design, and implementation, often due to constraints or overlooked requirements. Common consequences of exploiting this weakness include the ability for an attacker to read application data, which is considered to have a high likelihood. This weakness is cataloged under the Base level of abstraction in CWE, suggesting specific methods for detection and prevention are available, and is related to both software and hardware contexts, including system-on-chip architectures.

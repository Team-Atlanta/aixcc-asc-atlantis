CWE-862 refers to the security weakness when a software product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. Authorization is the process of determining whether a user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource. If there are no access control checks, users may be able to access data or perform actions that they should not have permission to do so. Consequences of missing authorization include information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution. Various detection methods, like automated static analysis or manual analysis, can be used to find this type of bug. Mitigations include dividing the product into distinct access areas and enforcing role-based access control.

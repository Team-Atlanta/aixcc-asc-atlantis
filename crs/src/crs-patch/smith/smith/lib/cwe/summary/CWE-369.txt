CWE-369, known as the "Divide By Zero" weakness, refers to a common software vulnerability where a program attempts to divide a number by zero, resulting in a crash or unexpected behavior. This issue primarily stems from inadequate validation of input values or error conditions that are not properly handled. It is particularly prevalent in operations involving calculations with physical dimensions like size, length, width, and height. As a base-level weakness, CWE-369 is categorized under "Incorrect Calculation," and is related to "Numeric Errors" in software development contexts. It serves as a fundamental flaw that provides specific insights into detection and prevention methods. For instance, automated static analysis and fuzz testing are highly effective in identifying instances of this vulnerability by analyzing source or compiled code. Example scenarios provided demonstrate how the absence of input validation for the denominator in division operations, across various programming languages (Java, C/C++, C#), can lead to division by zero errors. Corrective examples highlight the importance of incorporating checks to prevent such errors by handling exceptional cases or validating inputs. This weakness, if exploited, leads to denial of service attacks by causing the program to crash, exit, or restart. The likelihood of exploit is rated as medium, underscoring the necessity for developers and security professionals to be vigilant in detecting and mitigating this vulnerability.

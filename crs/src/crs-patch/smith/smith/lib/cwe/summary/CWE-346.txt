CWE-346, known as Origin Validation Error, represents a class-level weakness wherein a product fails to adequately verify the legitimacy of the source of data or communication, essentially neglecting to confirm whether the data or communication originates from a valid source. This defect stands as a more generalized abstraction, not tied to any specific programming language or technology and encapsulates issues typically denominated by one or two dimensions among behavior, property, and resource. As a consequence of this deficiency, exploitations could potentially allow unauthorized access control breeches, ranging from gaining privileges or assuming identity to accessing functionalities that should not be available to the source in question. Illustrative instances include an Android application that removes user accounts upon receiving intents without verifying their origins, and web applications that execute special actions based on URL schemes communicated via WebView without confirming the trustworthiness of the source. These examples underscore the breadth of scenarios where such vulnerabilities can be manipulated by malicious entities. This weakness, outlined under the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) initiative, stands in relation to various other vulnerabilities and serves as a central point in understanding the complex web of security issues that exist in the realm of information and communication technologies.

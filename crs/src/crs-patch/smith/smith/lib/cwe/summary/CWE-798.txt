The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE-798) refers to the use of hard-coded credentials in a product. Hard-coded credentials, which can be a password or cryptographic key, leave significant vulnerabilities in software. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to bypass intended authentication procedures, as the fixed set of credentials are either ingoing (checking incoming credentials against its hard-coded credentials) or outgoing (containing hard-coded credentials for connecting to another system or component). 

Both cases pose serious security issues. For instance, if a hardcoded password for an administration account becomes known, anyone with knowledge of it can access the product, leading to extensive attacks like worms. If the product connects to another system and contains hardcoded credentials, any user of the program could potentially extract the password. If these credentials are ever discovered or published, it could lead to substantial security breaches. 

Therefore, it is crucial to avoid hard-coding passwords or encryption keys directly into the code where they can be easily discovered, and instead use secure methods of storing and retrieving these credentials.

CWE-1072 refers to a software weakness where a product accesses a data resource, typically a database, without utilizing connection pooling mechanisms. This practice can lead to decreased performance due to the overhead and time consumed in opening and closing new connections for each data access request, rather than reusing existing connections efficiently. This inefficiency not only affects the application's speed but, if exploitable by an attacker, can potentially introduce vulnerabilities by exacerbating performance issues. It is identified as an indirect quality issue, highlighting that while it may not directly result in security flaws, it could indirectly facilitate or obscure security vulnerabilities. This weakness is acknowledged in broader discussions about resource lifecycle management and bad coding practices, underlining its significance in both performance efficiency and software quality contexts. However, CWE-1072 is not intended for mapping to real-world vulnerabilities directly due to its nature as a quality-related issue without direct security implications.

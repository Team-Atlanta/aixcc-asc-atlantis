CWE-182 describes a weakness where data filtering reduces information to an unsafe value, breaching an expected security property. This base-level weakness, largely independent of specific technology or resource, points to filtering mechanisms that inadvertently simplify or "collapse" data into values that can be exploited to bypass security measures. An example of this includes manipulating file pathnames that, through filtering processes, resolve to unauthorized or unintended paths. Such behavior might follow from class weaknesses related to incorrect handling of characters in inputs (e.g., regular expressions) or can precede vulnerabilities like path traversal, where sequences of directory-level navigations (e.g., "...." or ".../...//") are reduced to paths granting unintended access. Key mitigations focus on rigorous input validation, advocating for a whitelist approach that only allows known, safe inputs and rejects or transforms those that do not strictly conform to predefined specifications. This might include thorough validation of input properties such as length, type, acceptable value ranges, and adherence to business logic. Additionally, canonicalization of inputs to a consistent, expected format before validation is crucial to prevent bypassing security checks through double encoding or similar tactics. Automated static analysis is highlighted as an effective detection method for identifying instances of this weakness by analyzing code for patterns connecting input sources with potentially vulnerable sinks without the need for execution.

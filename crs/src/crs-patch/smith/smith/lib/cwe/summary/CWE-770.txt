CWE-770 involves the allocation of resources (such as memory, CPU, file descriptors) without imposing any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be allocated, contrary to what the intended security policy specifies. This flaw exists at a base level in the CWE structure, emphasizing that it is mostly independent of a particular resource or technology but detailed enough to enable specific detection and prevention methods. It arises when software, in handling limited resources, fails to enforce quotas, resource limits, or other protective mechanisms. This lack of control can lead to various types of denial-of-service (DoS) conditions as attackers exploit the vulnerability to consume excessive amounts of resources quickly or request resources larger than necessary. This not only hampers the correct functioning of the application but also can prevent legitimate access and operations within the system. The weakness is relevant and dangerous across different abstraction levels—spanning software development, research concepts, and architectural design—indicating its broad impact on security. Proper mitigation involves implementing checks to limit resource use, monitoring resource consumption, and designing systems with throttling mechanisms to manage and mitigate excessive resource requests effectively.

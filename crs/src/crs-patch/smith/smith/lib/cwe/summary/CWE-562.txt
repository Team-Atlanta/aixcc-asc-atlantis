CWE-562 describes a programming weakness where a function erroneously returns the address of a local variable allocated on the stack. This mistake can result in unpredictable program behavior, including crashes, because the stack address returned becomes invalid once the function exits. The local variables on the stack are meant to be temporary and their addresses should not be used outside the scope of the function. However, if a function returns a pointer to such a local variable, subsequent function calls may overwrite the stack space previously occupied by the variable, leading to potential alteration of the pointer's value or the program crashing when the pointer is dereferenced.

This vulnerability is categorized under "Base" abstraction because it is relatively independent of the specific technologies but detailed enough to offer guidance for detection and prevention. It's a concern predominantly in languages like C and C++ where manual memory management is prevalent. The consequences of exploiting such a vulnerability include unauthorized code execution, memory modification or reading, and denial of service through application crashes. To mitigate this issue, static analysis tools can be employed during the testing phase to identify instances where a function might be returning the address of a stack variable. This weakness is a fundamental programming error that can lead to severe security and stability problems within software applications.

CWE-1118 addresses the issue of insufficient documentation regarding error handling techniques. This weakness concerns the failure to adequately describe how errors and exceptions are managed within a system. Proper documentation should detail the methods employed for handling errors across various layers, including modules, executables, compilable code units, and callable functions. The lack of comprehensive error handling documentation can lead to misunderstandings and mishandling of errors, potentially making systems more vulnerable to security risks indirectly. It is categorized under "Documentation Issues" and is considered an indirect weakness, meaning it primarily affects software quality and might only have a peripheral impact on security by potentially facilitating the introduction or concealment of more direct security weaknesses. This CWE entry emphasizes that while it predominantly represents a quality concern without direct security ramifications, attention should be redirected towards weaknesses with clearer security implications for addressing and mapping vulnerabilities.

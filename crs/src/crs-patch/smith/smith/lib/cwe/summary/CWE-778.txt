CWE-778, Insufficient Logging, identifies a security vulnerability arising from the failure to adequately record security-critical events within a system, or the omission of important details about such events when logging. This base-level weakness is mainly independent of a specific technology or resource but provides enough detail to guide the detection and prevention of related vulnerabilities. Proper logging of security-relevant incidents, such as failed login attempts, is crucial for detecting malicious activities and facilitating forensic analysis post-attack. Insufficient logging may lead to significant gaps in security telemetry, especially with the increasing adoption of cloud storage resources that might default to minimal logging to reduce costs. The vulnerability affects various platforms, including cloud computing environments, and is not specific to any programming language. The consequences of such a weakness include making it more difficult to trace and understand the cause of issues or attacks, directly impacting the non-repudiation and technical integrity of the system. Examples of poor practices include disabling security-critical event logging in configuration files or failing to log failed authentication attempts in application code. Mitigation strategies involve using centralized logging mechanisms, ensuring comprehensive logging of all security-related events, and correctly setting the level of detail in logs to aid in system monitoring without incurring unnecessary costs or overwhelming the log files.

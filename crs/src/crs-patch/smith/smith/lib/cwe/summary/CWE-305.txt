CWE-305, known as "Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness," is a security issue where the authentication process is theoretically sound, but can be circumvented due to another, more fundamental weakness. This base-level weakness is not specific to any language or technology but has sufficient detail to inform specific detection and prevention methods across various dimensions such as behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. It commonly emerges during the implementation phase of software development when implementing architectural security tactics. The consequences of this weakness primarily affect access control, allowing attackers to bypass protection mechanisms. Examples of real-world vulnerabilities include instances where the password comparison mechanism is flawed, enabling attackers to gain access with minimal information, such as matching the first character of the password. This CWE is part of larger categories related to authentication errors and is significant for understanding, preventing, and mitigating authentication-related vulnerabilities in software systems.

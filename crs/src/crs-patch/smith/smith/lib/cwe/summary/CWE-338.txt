CWE-338 addresses the issue of utilizing a cryptographically weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in situations requiring security measures. The core of this weakness lies in the employment of non-cryptographic PRNGs within cryptographic contexts, making the cryptography vulnerable to certain types of attacks due to predictable outcomes generated by the weak PRNG. Such generators are not designed for cryptographic security and may favor less processing power or conserving system entropy sources, yet their predictable nature can be exploited to break encryption or authentication mechanisms. For instance, if a PRNG is used for generating session IDs or cryptographic keys, attackers might easily predict these values and breach access controls. Effective mitigation involves using hardware-based random number generation or cryptographically secure functions designed for security contexts to ensure unpredictability and resist potential attacks. Automated static analysis tools can identify instances of this weakness by analyzing code for the use of inappropriate PRNG functions in security-sensitive parts of an application.

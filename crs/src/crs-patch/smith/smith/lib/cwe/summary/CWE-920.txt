CWE-920, "Improper Restriction of Power Consumption," identifies a vulnerability where a product fails to adequately regulate its power usage in environments where power is a finite resource, like in embedded or mobile devices dependent on batteries. Such a flaw could result in devices ceasing to function by prematurely depleting their power source, or incurring additional costs to the device owner due to increased power consumption. This issue is not dependent on a specific programming language but is relevant to devicesâ€”particularly mobile ones. Various components, including the display, CPU, disk I/O, GPS, microphone, and USB interface, could be manipulated to elevate power consumption unnecessarily. This vulnerability is classified under "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption" and is a member of the resource management errors category, highlighting its potential to cause denial of service through resource exhaustion. Understanding and mitigating this vulnerability involves both design and architectural considerations to prevent such exploitative power consumption.

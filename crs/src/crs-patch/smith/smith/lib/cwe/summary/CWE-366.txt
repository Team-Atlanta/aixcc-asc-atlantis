CWE-366 details a type of vulnerability known as a race condition within a thread, where two threads of execution simultaneously use a resource, leading to the potential for resources to be used while in an invalid state. This situation results in an undefined state of execution as the sequence of operations cannot be guaranteed, posing integrity and security risks by altering execution logic or causing an unexpected state. As a 'Base' level weakness, CWE-366 provides specific detection and prevention methods, primarily focusing on the need for appropriate synchronization and locking mechanisms to manage access to shared resources in a multithreaded environment. Relationships to other weaknesses emphasize the broader issues with concurrent execution and improper synchronization. Mitigation strategies include using existing locking mechanisms or implementing resource-locking validations, with automated static analysis (SAST) offering high effectiveness for detection. Common languages like C, C++, Java, and C# are susceptible to this weakness, which has medium likelihood of exploitation and can impact system process integrity by allowing data to be altered into a bad state if a lock is compromised.

CWE-763 pertains to the release of an invalid pointer or reference, encapsulating scenarios where a program attempts to release a memory resource to the system using an incorrect release function or an appropriate release function incorrectly. This includes situations where memory allocated through one method is deallocated with a non-compatible function, or where the right function is used in the wrong way. For instance, memory could be allocated with one function (e.g., `malloc`) and deallocated with a different, incompatible one (e.g., `delete` in C++), or the deallocating functions might be used improperly. This weakness, classified as a base level, highlights a common problem across software development where inappropriate memory management can lead to critical vulnerabilities such as memory corruption, unauthorized code execution, or denial of service. It exists independently of specific platforms or technologies yet is detailed enough to guide the identification and prevention of related issues. Effective mitigation involves matching memory management routines, employing smart pointers in C++, and utilizing libraries or frameworks that prevent or simplify the correct management of memory. Dynamic memory management problem detection tools like Valgrind can also be instrumental in identifying instances of CWE-763 in software.

CWE-386 refers to a security weakness wherein a constant symbolic reference (an identifier) to an object is mistakenly used such that the reference might resolve to a different object than intended over time. This base-level weakness encapsulates issues related to behavior, property, technology, language, and resource, making it mostly independent of a specific resource or technology but detailed enough to offer direct methods for detection and prevention. The danger of this weakness lies in its potential to allow attackers to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data by exploiting the misaligned symbolic references to access or modify resources improperly. Consequences include the possibility of gaining privileges, assuming another's identity, modifying or reading application data and files, or even deleting critical files such as logs to hide malicious activities. This particular CWE entry is critical for understanding and mapping the root causes of vulnerabilities due to its base level of abstraction and its applicability across a variety of platforms, not being limited to any specific programming language or environment. Moreover, its significance is reaffirmed by its links to other related weaknesses and its role in the broader context of security issues related to incorrect name or reference resolution, race conditions, and external control of references to resources.

CWE-59 addresses the vulnerability known as "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')". This vulnerability occurs when a software product attempts to access a file based on its filename but fails to adequately prevent this filename from being interpreted as a link (or shortcut) that resolves to an unintended resource. This can lead to a variety of security issues including unauthorized reading, modification of files, or the bypassing of security mechanisms, potentially allowing attackers to execute unauthorized code. This weakness, fundamentally base-level, highlights the issue in software where the system does not correctly resolve filenames that could be manipulated to link to resources different from the intended ones.

The flaw can manifest in systems where soft links (or shortcuts in Windows terminology) can be exploited, especially in environments like UNIX or Windows, where their prevalence varies. The risk associated with this vulnerability is amplified in contexts where files or directories can be accessed or modified by unauthorized users, allowing them to traverse the file system to reach sensitive areas and perform illicit operations. Various related weaknesses expand on specific manifestations of this problem across different systems and technologies, including symlink attacks, hard link following, and the exploitation of Windows shortcuts. The introduction of this weakness is mostly tied to the implementation phase, implying a need for secure coding practices and robust architectural design to mitigate such risks. Common consequences include unauthorized data access or modification, execution of unauthorized commands, and compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and access controls. Detection and mitigation strategies involve a combination of static and dynamic analysis, careful design and architecture review, and adherence to the principle of least privilege.

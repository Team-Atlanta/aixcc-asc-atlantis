The bug, known as CWE-94 or Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'), refers to a flaw in software or applications. It occurs when a product constructs all or part of a code segment without properly neutralizing special elements that modify syntax or behavior of the code. This can be due to externally-influenced input that allows attackers to craft the code in such a way that it alters the product's intended control flow leading to arbitrary code execution. The weakness might enable injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane, meaning that the process's execution may be altered by sending code via legitimate data channels, without any other mechanism. The consequences may include bypassing protection mechanisms, gaining unauthorized access to resources, and executing unauthorized commands which eventually can lead to data loss or system instability. Mitigations involve refactoring programs, conducting regular static and dynamic tests, implementing stringent input validation strategies and running code in environments that restrict unauthorized execution of code.

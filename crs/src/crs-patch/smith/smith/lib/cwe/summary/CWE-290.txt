CWE-290, known as "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing," addresses a critical weakness in improperly implemented authentication schemes that are vulnerable to spoofing attacks. This base-level weakness, mostly independent of resources or technologies, underscores a significant security concern where attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms to access restricted resources or assume false identities. Often linked to inadequate verification processes, this vulnerability allows attackers to exploit the trust in client-side controls or identification checks fundamentally. For instance, relying solely on IP addresses or DNS information for authentication can be particularly risky. Attackers can spoof these identifiers, making systems believe the access request is coming from a trusted source when it is not. Demonstrative examples include scenarios where authentication is based solely on matching IP addresses or DNS lookups with trusted entities, which can be easily manipulated through spoofing or DNS cache poisoning, respectively.

Such vulnerabilities can have severe consequences, including the bypass of protection mechanisms and unauthorized privilege escalation, giving attackers access to functionalities or information otherwise off-limits. The problem is accentuated by common implementation practices and may be introduced during various development phases, particularly at implementation. Historical observations and reference examples, including CVE records, underscore the real-world implications and exploitation of this vulnerability, highlighting the necessity for developers and security professionals to consider multifactor authentication and robust verification techniques beyond simple trust in client-generated data or single-factor checks based on spoofable identifiers.

CWE-303 addresses a security weakness concerning the incorrect implementation of an established authentication algorithm. Despite the intent to use a reliable algorithm for authentication purposes, flaws in how the algorithm is carried out can inadvertently enable authentication to be bypassed. This sort of vulnerability emanates from errors made during the implementation phase, where the architectural security measures are not accurately realized in code or system configuration. As a base-level weakness, it is defined with sufficient detail, highlighting its occurrence across various technologies and languages without being tied to a specific one. The consequence of such a flaw is severe, as it directly impacts access control by allowing unauthorized access, thereby bypassing protection mechanisms meant to secure the system. Instances where conditions in code were incorrectly combined (such as using ‘and’ instead of ‘or’), demonstrate how simple logical errors can lead to such vulnerabilities. This CWE is part of broader categories focusing on authentication errors and is key for those mapping vulnerabilities to specific weaknesses, aiding in the identification and mitigation of security risks related to authentication.

CWE-1065 outlines a fundamental weakness related to runtime resource management control elements in software components designed to operate on application servers. This specific weakness arises when products utilize deployed components from application servers but resort to low-level functions or methods for managing resources instead of leveraging the application server's provided API. Such practices can compromise the reliability of the product, making it prone to failures or reduced performance. Should an attacker gain access to the relevant code, this mismanagement could potentially be exploited, transforming a reliability issue into a security vulnerability.

This weakness is categorized under the broader context of improper adherence to coding standards (CWE-710) and bad coding practices (CWE-1006), highlighting its nature as an indirect threat that could facilitate or obscure security-relevant weaknesses. While CWE-1065 itself is identified more as a quality issue without direct security implications, it's advised to address this problem by following recommended coding practices and making proper use of the application server's API for resource management. The CWE notes that although this entry is primarily concerned with quality, weaknesses specifically centered around insecure behavior with more direct security implications should be prioritized for correction.

CWE-708: Incorrect Ownership Assignment involves a situation where a product incorrectly assigns an ownership role to a resource, placing the owner outside of the intended control sphere. This misassignment could potentially allow unauthorized actors to manipulate the resource. This base-level weakness is characterized by issues related to behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. It falls under the broader class of improper ownership management and is also related to insufficient verification of data authenticity, business logic errors, and authorization of actors. Common consequences of this weakness include violations of confidentiality and integrity, where attackers might read and modify application data without proper access permissions. Observed examples range from filesystem and OS misconfigurations to incorrect handling of user privileges upon logout, affecting a wide array of software and systems, including backup and file management programs. Mitigation strategies encompass policy review of privileges and owners, as well as employing automated tools during the testing phase to ensure proper privilege settings. This CWE is part of several major security frameworks, including the OWASP Top Ten and various CWE categorizations focused on access control and management.

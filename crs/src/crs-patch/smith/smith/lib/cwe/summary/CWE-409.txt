CWE-409 concerns the improper handling of highly compressed data, specifically when a compressed input with an extremely high compression ratio results in a disproportionately large output. This vulnerability, characterized as a "decompression bomb," involves small, highly compressed files (such as a ZIP file) that can significantly amplify to produce a massive amount of data upon decompression. This issue, fundamentally a base-level weakness, underscores the potential for dramatic resource consumption when software fails to manage or incorrectly manages the decompression of highly compressed inputs. It exposes systems to various denial of service (DoS) attacks, including amplification, crash, exit, restart, and extensive consumption of CPU and memory resources. Demonstrative examples, like the XML bomb, illustrate how exponentially expanding entities within a document can consume resources far beyond expectations, leading to system performance degradation or failure. This vulnerability is not specific to any language and can have severe consequences on availability by bogging down system resources, showcasing the critical need for appropriate handling and validation of compressed data to prevent such exploit scenarios.

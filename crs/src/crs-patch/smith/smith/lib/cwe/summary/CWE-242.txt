CWE-242 focuses on the use of inherently dangerous functions that can never be guaranteed to work safely, posing security risks regardless of their application. Such functions, originally designed without considering security implications, exhibit dangerous behaviors irrespective of their usage context. A notable example is the `gets()` function in C, which lacks bounds checking for its input, enabling attackers to cause buffer overflow by supplying input of arbitrary size. Another example involves the misuse of the `>>` operator when reading into statically-allocated character arrays, which similarly does not perform bounds checking, thus presenting an overflow risk. The inherent danger of these functions lies in their inability to restrict the size of their input, making them prime targets for exploiting buffer overflows and related vulnerabilities. Mitigation strategies include avoiding the use of these dangerous functions and instead opting for safer alternatives that enforce bounds checking and input validation. Additionally, employing static analysis tools can help identify and rectify the use of such unsafe practices in software development, thereby enhancing the security posture of the developed applications.

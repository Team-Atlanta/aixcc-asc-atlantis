CWE-334 deals with a fundamental security weakness related to the generation of random values within software systems. This flaw arises when the number of possible random values generated by a system is less than what is required for secure operation, significantly increasing the likelihood of a successful brute force attack by malicious actors. Specifically, this insufficiency in randomness can lead to scenarios where attackers can easily predict or guess the values being used by the system for critical security functionalities, such as authentication and authorization mechanisms. This can result in unauthorized access to systems, potentially bypassing protective measures designed to safeguard sensitive information or operational capabilities. CWE-334 is categorized under "Small Space of Random Values" and is recognized as a base level weakness, indicating that while it is somewhat independent of specific technologies or resources, it contains enough detail to guide the detection and prevention of this issue across various implementation contexts. Mitigation strategies for this weakness include leveraging libraries or frameworks that adhere to recognized standards for cryptographic operations, such as FIPS 140-2, to ensure adequate randomness and entropy in value generation processes.

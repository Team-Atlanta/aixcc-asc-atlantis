CWE-494, titled "Download of Code Without Integrity Check," refers to a software flaw where a program downloads source code or an executable from a remote location and executes it without sufficiently verifying the code's origin and integrity. This oversight leaves a window open for attackers, who can exploit this weakness by compromising the host server, performing DNS spoofing, or altering the code in transit, thus executing malicious code. The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) system categorizes this issue under base-level weaknesses, indicating that it has sufficient details to outline specific detection and prevention methods, albeit being relatively independent of a specific resource or technology.

The core issue arises from the failure of software systems to implement proper verification processes for remotely sourced code, which could include cryptographic signatures or checksum comparisons to ensure the code's authenticity and integrity. The consequences of such a weakness can significantly compromise the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the affected system. Execution of unauthorized code, logic alteration, exposure to adversarial input, or outright denial of service are potential impacts, with a medium likelihood of exploit, according to CWE criteria. Mitigation strategies involve implementing secure design practices such as encryption of code before transmission, use of well-vetted libraries for integrity checks, running code with limited privileges, and employing sandboxing techniques to limit potential damage. The detection of this weakness may require manual analysis, static code analysis tools, or monitoring tools that observe the software's interactions with the network and operating system.

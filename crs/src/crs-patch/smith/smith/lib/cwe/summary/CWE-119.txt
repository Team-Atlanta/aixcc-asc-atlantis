The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE-119) refers to failure in restricting operations within the bounds of a memory buffer. In some languages, direct addressing of memory locations is allowed without automatic validation of these locations' association with the referenced memory buffer. This may lead to read or write operations performed on memory locations associated with other variables, data structures, or internal program data. It could result in an attacker executing arbitrary code, altering intended control flow, reading sensitive information, or causing system crash. This issue is common in languages without adequate memory management support and the consequences can vary depending on the language, platform, and chip architecture used.

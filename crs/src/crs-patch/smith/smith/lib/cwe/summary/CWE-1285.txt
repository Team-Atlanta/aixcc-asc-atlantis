CWE-1285 is defined as "Improper Validation of Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input." This vulnerability arises when an application receives input meant to specify an index, position, or offset within an indexable resource, such as a buffer or file, but fails to adequately validate or incorrectly validates whether the specified index/position/offset holds the required properties. The absence of proper validation can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of parts of these resources, resulting in issues like buffer overflows, unwarranted resource usage, or unexpected application failures. This weakness, being at the Base level of abstraction, offers specific methods for detection and prevention while remaining largely independent of a particular resource or technology. It's identified as a fundamental input validation issue, linked to broader and more abstract weaknesses, and can lead to more specific variants concerning the improper validation of array indexes or address validations in certain I/O control codes. Examples provided illustrate scenarios in C and Java where improper validation of an array index based on user input could lead to potential security breaches, such as out-of-bounds access, and suggests validating inputs against an approved range to mitigate such risks. Effective mitigation involves adopting an "accept known good" strategy for input validation, emphasizing the necessity to reject or transform any input that does not conform to strict specifications, thus highlighting the importance of rigorous input validation in preventing this category of vulnerabilities.

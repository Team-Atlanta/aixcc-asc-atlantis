CWE-1335 pertains to the incorrect bitwise shift of an integer, identified as a base-level weakness that can lead to vulnerabilities when an integer is shifted by an inappropriate amount. Such inappropriate amounts include shifting by a negative value or by a value that equals or exceeds the number of bits in the integer. This can yield unexpected or indeterminate results due to the undefined behavior in various programming languages and the differing implementations across computer architectures. The compilers and interpreters typically do not check for the validity of the shift amount, which can lead to errors. Shifting an integer by a negative amount can produce vastly different results than intended, depending on the architecture and the compilers used. It is mentioned that this kind of operation has an undefined result in some languages.

The consequence of exploiting this weakness could lead to integrity issues, including denial of service through crashes, exits, or restarts of applications. The vulnerability is relevant across several programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and JavaScript, and is not specific to any operating system or technology, indicating its widespread relevance. Mitigation involves explicitly checking and validating shift amounts to prevent over-shifts or negative shifts. This CWE ID is suitable for mapping real-world vulnerabilities to their root causes at a preferred abstraction level, highlighting the importance of accurately understanding and applying the concept to secure software development practices.

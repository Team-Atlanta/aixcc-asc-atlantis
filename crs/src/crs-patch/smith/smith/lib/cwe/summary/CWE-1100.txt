CWE-1100, titled "Insufficient Isolation of System-Dependent Functions," addresses a base level weakness where system-dependent functionality is not properly isolated into separate standalone modules. This lack of isolation complicates the process of maintaining or porting the product, thereby indirectly affecting security. This is because it becomes more difficult or time-consuming to identify and correct vulnerabilities, or might inadvertently facilitate the introduction of vulnerabilities. The weakness is considered at a base level of abstraction, denoting that it provides enough details to offer specific detection and prevention methods without being tied to a particular resource or technology. It is categorized under "Insufficient Encapsulation" (CWE-1061) and also associated with "Encapsulation Issues" (CWE-1227), highlighting its relevance to common coding practices and encapsulation problems. The consequences mainly affect maintainability, rendering the software harder to manage or update, which in turn can lead to indirect security problems due to the increased difficulty in managing vulnerabilities. This CWE entry is significant for understanding how the structural design choices in software development can impact security and maintainability.

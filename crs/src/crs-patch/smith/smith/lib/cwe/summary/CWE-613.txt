CWE-613 refers to Insufficient Session Expiration, a vulnerability where a website fails to adequately invalidate session credentials or IDs after a user has logged out or after a certain period of inactivity. This flaw falls under the Base level of abstraction, indicating that it offers specific enough detail for targeted detection and prevention methods across various technologies and resources. Insufficient session expiration can allow attackers to reuse old session credentials for unauthorized access. This weakness is particularly dangerous as it can facilitate various attack vectors, including the interception of session IDs through network sniffing or cross-site scripting attacks, thereby enabling unauthorized access to sensitive user sessions. It also poses a threat in environments where devices are shared among users, such as libraries or internet cafes, where subsequent users can potentially hijack sessions left active by previous users. Mitigation strategies include setting appropriate session and credential expiration policies. This weakness is identifiable through automated static analysis with a high effectiveness rating, highlighting its prevalence and potential impact on access control and authentication mechanisms. Its inclusion in several OWASP Top Ten lists over the years underscores its significance in web application security.

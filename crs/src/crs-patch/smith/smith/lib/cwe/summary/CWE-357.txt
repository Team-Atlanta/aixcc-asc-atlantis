CWE-357: Insufficient UI Warning of Dangerous Operations refers to a situation where an application's user interface fails to provide adequate warnings for dangerous or sensitive operations, such that the warnings are not noticeable enough to attract user attention. This weakness, classified under the Base level of abstraction by the Common Weakness Enumeration framework, represents a fundamental issue that remains mostly independent of a specific resource or technology but has enough detail to suggest methods for detection and prevention. It is pertinent to both software and hardware contexts and is not specific to any programming language. The consequences of such a weakness include, but are not limited to, the potential for attackers to exploit the insufficient warning to conduct unauthorized activities without being detected by users. A notable example includes CVE-2007-1099, where users were not sufficiently warned of a host key mismatch, possibly leading to security breaches. This type of weakness emphasizes the importance of designing and implementing clear and effective warnings for users about potentially harmful operations to mitigate security risks.

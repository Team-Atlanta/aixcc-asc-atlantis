CWE-586 pertains to the explicit calling of the `finalize()` method from outside an object's finalizer in Java, a practice that goes against general conventions and can lead to potential security vulnerabilities. While Java's Language Specification permits calling the `finalize()` method from locations other than the finalizer, doing so usually poses risks. Specifically, making explicit calls to `finalize()` can result in it being invoked multiple times: once through the explicit call and again after the object has been garbage collected, potentially leading to unexpected application states or degradation of quality. This issue falls under the broader classification of insufficient adherence to expected conventions (CWE-1076) and is related to problems that involve multiple operations on a resource in a context intended for a single operation (CWE-675). It is primarily concerned with issues of software integrity and the consequential impacts that can arise, including the system reaching an unexpected state or a general decline in the application's quality. Mitigation strategies emphasize avoiding explicit calls to `finalize()` and suggest the use of static analysis tools for detecting such calls during the implementation and testing phases. This weakness is recognized for its relevance in the domain of bad coding practices, and it's crucial to consider this in the context of Java programming to maintain the security and robustness of software systems.

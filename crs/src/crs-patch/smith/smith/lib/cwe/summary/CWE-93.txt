CWE-93 addresses the security weakness of Improper Neutralization of CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) Sequences, known as 'CRLF Injection'. This base-level weakness occurs when a product uses CRLF sequences for special purposes, such as separating lines or records, but fails to properly neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes these sequences when they come from user inputs. CRLF Injection can lead to various security vulnerabilities, including HTTP response splitting, log forging, and data modification. The weakness is not specific to any programming language, indicating a widespread potential for exploitation across different platforms.

Mitigation strategies primarily involve avoiding the use of CRLF sequences as special elements, or, when their use is unavoidable, appropriately filtering or quoting CRLF sequences in user-controlled inputs to prevent their misuse. Detection of this vulnerability can be highly effective through automated static analysis tools (Static Application Security Testing, SAST) that analyze code for potentially vulnerable patterns linking inputs to critical points in the application. The importance of addressing CWE-93 is underscored by its inclusion in various categorizations and lists such as the OWASP Top Ten, highlighting the critical need for developers and security specialists to understand and mitigate this type of weakness in software development and implementation phases.

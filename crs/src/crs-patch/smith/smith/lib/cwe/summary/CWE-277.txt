CWE-277 outlines the vulnerability related to Insecure Inherited Permissions, where a software product improperly defines a set of permissions that objects created by the program inherit, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification. This weakness, classified as a Variant because it is linked to a specific type of product or technology, indicates a more specific flaw than a Base weakness, typically concerning behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. It is a symptom of broader system design flaws, especially with regard to how permissions and privileges are managed, suggesting a need for careful control over the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Effective mitigation includes ensuring system design incorporates compartmentalization and the principle of least privilege to create clear trust boundaries, preventing sensitive data from moving outside secure zones, and minimizing the misuse of privileges. This weakness is significant enough to have relationships and mappings with broader categories and other specific weaknesses, indicating its widespread relevance and the importance of addressing it in both the architecture/design and implementation phases to enhance software security.

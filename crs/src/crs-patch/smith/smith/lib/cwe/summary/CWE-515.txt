CWE-515 describes a "Covert Storage Channel" vulnerability where information is surreptitiously transferred between programs through the use of bits set by one program and read by another, beyond standard operation, specifically for the purpose of encoding and conveying hidden information. This type of vulnerability typically involves the unauthorized storage of out-of-band data within messages or files for the purpose of memory reuse or secret communication. Covert channels can be either storage or timing channels, with examples including manipulating a file designated for audit information to secretly transmit user passwords, or utilizing file names or status bits readable by all users as a signaling mechanism for the file's content. Steganography is highlighted as a prime example of a covert storage channel, where information is concealed in a manner that is supposed to be undetectable to everyone except the intended recipient. This vulnerability's exploitation can significantly impact an organization's confidentiality and integrity by leaking sensitive information about the system or its data to attackers, who can further use this knowledge to launch sophisticated attacks. Mitigation strategies involve ensuring the proper zeroing of all reserved fields before message transmission and avoiding the inclusion of unnecessary data within messages.

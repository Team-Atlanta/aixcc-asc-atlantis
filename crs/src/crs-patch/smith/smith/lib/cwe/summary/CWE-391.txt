CWE-391: Unchecked Error Condition is a classification of a weakness where exceptions and other error conditions are ignored or not handled appropriately. This oversight can potentially allow an attacker to induce unexpected behavior in the software without detection. The weakness is described at a base level abstraction, suggesting it is somewhat independent of specific technologies or resources but detailed enough to provide insights for detection and prevention. CWE-391 is highlighted for its relevance across various aspects of development and security, including software development, architectural concepts, and quality measures. It is primarily introduced during the implementation phase due to inadequate handling of architectural security tactics.

The consequences of ignoring error conditions can vary significantly, affecting the integrity of an application by causing unexpected states or altering execution logic, with a medium likelihood of exploit. Mitigation strategies involve selecting programming languages that enforce handling of exceptions, using updated API versions to catch new exceptions, and ensuring all exceptions are caught and properly handled to maintain system state integrity. Automated static analysis tools are noted for their high effectiveness in detecting instances of CWE-391 by analyzing code for patterns where error conditions are not checked. This CWE entry is notable for its broad applicability across various programming languages and systems, underscoring the universal importance of proper error handling in software development. The entry also mentions potential deprecation due to its widespread interpretations and overlaps with other CWEs, suggesting CWE-252, CWE-1069, and CWE-248 as more focused alternatives for error condition handling issues.

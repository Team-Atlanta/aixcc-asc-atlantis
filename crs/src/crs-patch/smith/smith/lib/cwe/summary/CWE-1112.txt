CWE-1112 addresses the issue of incomplete documentation related to program execution mechanisms in software and hardware. This weakness stems from not fully specifying all the controls or influences over how a program operates, which may involve aspects such as environmental variables, configuration files, registry keys, command-line options, or system settings. Such insufficient documentation constitutes a base-level weakness, meaning it is somewhat independent of a particular resource or technology but detailed enough to suggest specific methodologies for detection and prevention.

This weakness is categorized under "Documentation Issues" and is primarily considered a quality issue rather than a direct security vulnerability. It serves as a pointer to investigate more specific insecure behaviors with direct security implications. The CWE ID 1112 is not intended for mapping to real-world vulnerabilities due to its nature as a quality concern with no immediate security ramifications. This categorization helps to differentiate between mere quality shortcomings and those deficiencies that could have clear security consequences.

CWE-502, also known as deserialization of untrusted data, refers to a common software weakness where the product deserializes untrusted data without verifying its validity. This often happens when objects are serialized for communication or later use. However, deserialized data can be modified without using the provided accessor functions if it doesn't use cryptography for protection. Even then, any cryptography would still be client-side security, which is considered a dangerous security assumption. If developers place no restrictions on "gadget chains", which self-execute during deserialization, attackers can leverage them to perform unauthorized actions like creating a shell. Mitigation strategies include using signing/sealing features to ensure that deserialized data hasn't been modified, populating a new object during deserialization, and making fields transient to protect them from deserialization. Automated static analysis can effectively detect this weakness.

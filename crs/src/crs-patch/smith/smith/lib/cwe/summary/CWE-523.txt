CWE-523: Unprotected Transport of Credentials focuses on vulnerabilities arising when user credentials are not adequately protected during their transmission from the client to the server. This base-level weakness, mostly independent of specific technologies or resources, highlights the risk of credentials being intercepted or tampered with due to inadequate security measures on login pages and other sensitive data transmissions. The core of this issue lies in the lack of encryption for HTTP messages, a problem effectively addressed by implementing SSL (Secure Socket Layer), which ensures data confidentiality and integrity. By encrypting these messages, SSL thwarts potential eavesdropping and alteration of message contents by attackers. Mitigation strategies emphasize the enforcement of SSL usage for login pages and other sensitive information transmittal, even if the entire site does not use SSL, to aid in phishing attack prevention by allowing server identity verification through valid and trusted server certificates. Automated static analysis is highlighted as a highly effective detection method for this weakness, capable of identifying potentially vulnerable patterns by analyzing the code without execution. This weakness is critical in understanding and preventing unauthorized access control breaches, such as gaining privileges or assuming identity, and is integral to broader categories and views related to credentials management errors, encryption of data, and cryptographic failures, aligning with several OWASP Top Ten categories related to broken authentication and session management.

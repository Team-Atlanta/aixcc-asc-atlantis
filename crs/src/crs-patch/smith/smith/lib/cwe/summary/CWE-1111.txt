CWE-1111 refers to a type of weakness characterized by the inadequate documentation of inputs, outputs, or system/software interfaces in a product. This problem is categorized as a "Base" level weakness because it is still somewhat independent of a resource or technology, yet detailed enough to suggest specific detection and prevention methods. It spans across two or three dimensions, including behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. This weakness is primarily a quality issue without direct security implications, positioned as neither a direct nor immediate security threat but could potentially make it easier to introduce or obscure security-relevant weaknesses. It has been flagged that this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities due to its nature as principally a quality concern. The entry highlights the importance of comprehensive documentation in mitigating indirect risks that could contribute to security vulnerabilities. Additionally, it suggests focusing on weaknesses that have more direct security implications and are specifically centered around insecure behaviors.

CWE-253, titled "Incorrect Check of Function Return Value," refers to a software weakness where a program fails to properly validate the return value of a function. This oversight prevents the detection of errors or exceptional conditions that may arise during the function's execution. Functions, especially critical ones, commonly return a value indicating the success or failure of their operations, thereby informing the program whether error handling is necessary. However, when these return values are not correctly checked, the software may not respond appropriately to errors, potentially leading to unexpected states, crashes, or other unintended behaviors. This vulnerability is not language-specific and can occur in any phase of implementation, but it is more prevalent when there is inadequate checking of function outputs for error conditions. The consequences of this weakness include compromising the availability and integrity of the application, with a possible low likelihood of exploit. Mitigation strategies involve using a programming language or compiler that mandates exception handling, and ensuring thorough checking of all function return values during implementation. This requires careful design consideration to return values or throw exceptions in case of errors, enhancing the software's robustness and reliability against such vulnerabilities.

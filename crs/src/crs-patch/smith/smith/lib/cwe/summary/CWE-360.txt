CWE-360, identified as "Trust of System Event Data," is a base-level security weakness where applications or systems incorrectly trust event data without sufficient verification, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities. Events serve as a messaging system providing control data to listening applications, but they often lack a robust authentication framework to verify the source's trustworthiness. In environments like Windows, any application can send events or messages to any other application within the same desktop environment, without authentication. Thus, if an application does not rigorously check the validity and safety of incoming messages, it could be manipulated by any other process on the desktop. This issue falls under the broader class of insufficient verification of data authenticity and is closely related to vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized actions such as privilege escalation or code execution by exploiting these trust relationships.

The CWE entry highlights that consequences of exploiting such weaknesses include compromising the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system, such as executing unauthorized commands or assuming another entity's identity. The likelihood of exploitation is considered high. Demonstrative examples show how attacks, like the Shatter attack, can bypass GUI protections to execute privileged actions. Mitigations focus on never trusting event data for security-sensitive operations without proper verification. This entry emphasises the importance of addressing these weaknesses in the architecture and design phase to prevent potential exploits that rely on the unwarranted trust of system event data.

CWE-771 refers to a security weakness where a program fails to properly maintain a reference to an allocated resource, leading to issues with resource reclamation. This type of weakness is significant because it holds the potential to cause depletion of available resources, preventing access to these resources by other processes. Notably, this concern may not apply in environments with automatic garbage collection, where removing all references to a resource signals it is ready for reclamation. The weakness is categorized under 'Base' abstraction in CWE, indicating it encompasses specific details to guide detection and prevention methods across various dimensions such as behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.

Mitigation strategies against CWE-771 involve employing resource-limiting settings available within the operating system or environment to prevent resource exhaustion. This includes the use of system calls like `setrlimit()` and `getrlimit()` in POSIX for managing system resources, implementing checks and handling for when the system approaches defined resource limits, and ensuring error handling is in place for scenarios where resources become unavailable. The seriousness of this weakness is highlighted by its linkage to various related issues in software development, including uncontrolled resource consumption and failures in resource lifecycle management, which emphasizes the need for careful management and monitoring of system resources to protect against potential exploits.

CWE-1204 refers to the vulnerability that arises when a cryptographic primitive, which relies on an Initialization Vector (IV) for its security measures, fails to generate IVs that are unpredictable or unique as required by cryptographic standards. This weakness, categorized under Base level abstraction, indicates that it provides enough detail to identify specific methods for detection and prevention while being somewhat independent of technology or resource specifics. Cryptographic primitives, like block ciphers, necessitate that IVs possess certain properties – such as uniqueness and unpredictability – to ensure the integrity of the cryptographic process. If these properties are compromised, for instance through a bug that generates weak IVs, the strength of the cryptographic protection can be substantially weakened, exposing the system to various attacks. The relevance of these properties may vary across different primitives but maintaining them is crucial to prevent the weakening or breaking of encryption through attacks targeting the IVs. The consequences of such vulnerabilities can lead to the confidentiality breach, where encrypted data can be compromised leading to unauthorized data disclosure. Examples include predictable IVs with CBC mode, and historical weaknesses like the WEP protocol in wireless networks, where short and observable IVs led to repeated IV use, making it easier for attackers to decrypt traffic. Mitigations for this issue include understanding the requirements of cipher modes being used and ensuring IVs are generated in a manner that preserves their intended security properties, such as through randomness and avoiding reuse. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides recommendations for IV generation across different cipher modes.

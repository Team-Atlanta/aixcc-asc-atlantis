CWE-772 describes a situation where a product fails to release a resource after its effective lifetime, meaning once the resource is no longer needed, it isn't properly released. This oversight can lead to potential attacks where adversaries cause a denial of service (DoS) by exploiting the allocation of these resources without triggering their release. Commonly affected resources include memory, CPU, disk space, and power or battery, among others. The weakness is classified at a base level of abstraction, indicating it provides enough detail to suggest specific detection and prevention methods but remains mostly independent of specific technology or resources. This classification makes it actionable for a wide range of users including tool developers, security researchers, and incident response analysts. CWE-772 is related to several other weaknesses and is a part of broader categories like Improper Resource Shutdown or Release, Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime, and similar variants. It signifies a fundamental issue in resource management errors which, if exploited, can lead to reduced availability of services or functionality by depleting critical system resources, thereby causing a denial of service. This weakness can be introduced during various phases of software development, especially during implementation, and has a high likelihood of exploitation. Various mitigation strategies include using languages that perform automatic garbage collection, being diligent about freeing all resources, and employing resource limitation settings provided by the operating system to prevent resource exhaustion.

CWE-115, termed "Misinterpretation of Input," is an identified weakness where a product incorrectly interprets input in a manner that affects security. This misunderstanding can arise from inputs supplied either by attackers or through interactions with other products, leading to potentially exploitable vulnerabilities. This weakness is classified as a "Base" level in the Common Weakness Enumeration, indicating it has enough detail to suggest specific detection and prevention methods while still being somewhat independent of the resources or technologies involved. Typically, it encapsulates issues spanning behavior, property, technology, language, and resource dimensions. Misinterpretation of input could result in an array of consequences, most notably leading to an unexpected state that compromises integrity. This can be seen in real-world exploitation examples, such as when a product misinterprets file extensions or fails to correctly import and process security settings from another product. Effective detection methods include fuzz testing, which employs a vast set of diverse inputs to uncover unforeseen results like crashes or memory corruption. CWE-115 is integral for understanding the abstract foundations of certain vulnerabilities, aiding in the mapping to real-world instances and emphasizing the necessity of careful interpretation of input across different platforms and languages.

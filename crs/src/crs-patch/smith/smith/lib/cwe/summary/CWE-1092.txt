CWE-1092 identifies the use of the same control element across multiple architectural layers of a product. This practice complicates the understanding and maintenance of the system, indirectly impacting security by making vulnerabilities more challenging and time-consuming to identify and fix. It may also inadvertently facilitate the introduction of vulnerabilities. Classified as an issue primarily related to quality with indirect security consequences, CWE-1092 highlights the importance of proper adherence to coding standards to maintain system integrity. This weakness, falling under the categories of poor coding practices and maintainability issues, emphasizes the need for distinct control elements in varying architectural layers to ensure clearer, more secure, and maintainable code structures.

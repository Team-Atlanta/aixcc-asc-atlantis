CWE-1113, titled "Inappropriate Comment Style," identifies a software weakness where the style or format of comments within source code is inconsistent or does not adhere to the expected standards for the project. This irregularity in commenting can impede the maintainability of the product by reducing the legibility of the code, which indirectly compromises security. The difficulty in navigating and interpreting the codebase may lead to extended time required to identify and correct vulnerabilities, or could potentially result in the introduction of new vulnerabilities. This weakness is a base-level issue, predominantly independent of specific resources or technologies but detailed enough to suggest specific detection and prevention methods. Although CWE-1113 is recognized as a quality concern rather than a direct security threat, it indirectly affects security by influencing the ease with which secure behaviors can be implemented or insecure behaviors can be identified and addressed. It belongs to broader categories focusing on bad coding practices and poor coding practices, underscoring the importance of standardizing comment styles to facilitate code understanding and maintenance.

CWE-131 refers to the incorrect calculation of buffer size, a foundational issue that can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities when the allocated buffer is smaller or larger than intended. This weakness, categorized under Base level in the Common Weakness Enumeration, emphasizes vulnerabilities that, while mostly independent of specific technologies, include sufficient detail to outline detection and prevention strategies across several dimensions, including behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. It lies at a pivotal intersection involving numerous related weaknesses, such as the misuse of `sizeof()` on a pointer type and improper restrictions on operations within the bounds of a memory buffer, indicating its prevalence across software development. 

Incidents of CWE-131 generally occur during the implementation phase and are highly exploitable, leading to severe consequences like denial of service, unauthorized code execution, memory corruption, and disclosure of sensitive information. Affected programming languages primarily include C and C++ due to their manual memory management practices. Mitigation strategies span several phases of the software development lifecycle, encompassing thorough input validation, adopting safe memory handling libraries, careful numerical calculations avoiding overflows, and leveraging compiler options for automatic detection of potential vulnerabilities. Defensive coding practices are also emphasized, recommending the avoidance of unbounded copy functions and ensuring allocation calculations explicitly include space for necessary terminators or sentinels.

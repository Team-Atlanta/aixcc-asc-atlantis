CWE-1284 focuses on the improper validation of specified quantities in input, encompassing various types such as size, length, frequency, price, rate, number of operations, time, among others, which are crucial for resource allocation and calculations within software and hardware systems. When these quantities are not appropriately validated, or when the validation is incorrect, it can lead to significant vulnerabilities including resource exhaustion, unexpected system failures, buffer overflows, and other malicious outcomes. This weakness, residing at the base level of abstraction, is characterized by its technical independence while still providing enough detail for specific detection and prevention methods. Its detrimental effects vary by context but often lead to significant security implications, as these quantities frequently influence code operations related to resource allocation or financial transactions.

The weakness is notably related to a broader class of issues concerning improper input validation and can lead to or be compounded by other specific weaknesses, such as unchecked input for loop conditions or memory allocation with excessive size value, demonstrating its critical nature in the security landscape. Demonstrative examples include scenarios where negative values or excessively large numbers are inputted for quantities like product orders or board dimensions, which can lead to financial loss or resource consumption attacks if not properly handled. Mitigation strategies emphasize rigorous input validation, adopting an "accept known good" approach where all input is treated as potentially malicious, and inputs are validated against a strict set of acceptable criteria to prevent exploitation. This approach is deemed highly effective in curbing the risks associated with CWE-1284.

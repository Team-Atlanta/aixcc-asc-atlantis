CWE-587 involves the unsafe practice of assigning fixed, specific memory addresses to pointers, excluding NULL or 0. This can lead to non-portable code because such fixed addresses may not be valid across different platforms or environments, which could cause programs to crash or behave unpredictably. The underlying issue is tied to the broader weakness categories that include the use of invariant values in changing contexts and the reliance on unspecified, undefined, or implementation-defined behaviors. Common programming languages such as C, C++, C#, and Assembly are susceptible to this problem, highlighting its wide relevance. The consequences of exploiting this weakness include unauthorized code execution, system crashes, and potential breaches of confidentiality and integrity by allowing attackers to read or modify memory. To mitigate this issue, developers are advised against setting pointers to fixed addresses and instead adopt dynamic and platform-agnostic memory management practices. Understanding this flaw and its implications is crucial for preventing security vulnerabilities that may arise from the improper handling of memory addresses.

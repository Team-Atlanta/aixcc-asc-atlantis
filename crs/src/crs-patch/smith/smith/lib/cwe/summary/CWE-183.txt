CWE-183 pertains to a security weakness involving overly permissive lists of allowed inputs within a software or hardware system's protection mechanism. This list, which is intended to determine which inputs are safe based on an established policy, is flawed because it allows inputs that are unsafe, consequently leading to potential vulnerabilities. The categorization of this weakness is recognized as a "Base" level, indicating a specific but technology-independent issue that outlines particular methods for both its detection and prevention. This vulnerability stands as a primary concern due to its potential to bypass access control mechanisms, thereby compromising the security of the system. The issue is commonly introduced during the implementation phase of development and is not restricted by language, suggesting a wide-reaching impact across various platforms. Among its consequences, the most notable is the potential to bypass protection mechanisms, posing a significant risk to access control within systems. Detection methods such as Automated Static Analysis offer a high level of effectiveness in identifying instances of this weakness by analyzing source code without execution. This CWE entry is critical for understanding and mapping real-world vulnerabilities, especially due to its base-level abstraction, which aids in identifying the root causes of such security flaws importantly.

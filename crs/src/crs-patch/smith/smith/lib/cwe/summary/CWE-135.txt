CWE-135 deals with an important security weakness: the incorrect calculation of multi-byte string lengths in software. This coding defect arises when a program does not properly compute the length of strings that consist of wide or multi-byte characters, leading to a range of vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, which potentially allow unauthorized code execution. Various modes of introduction for this weakness include errors during the implementation phase, particularly when allocating memory for strings without accurately accounting for the byte size of wide characters or the termination character. This mistake can result in buffer overflow conditions, which are exploitable for executing arbitrary code, crashing the program, or causing denial of service through resource consumption. Effective mitigation strategies encompass input validation to ensure the correctness of string length calculations and the use of appropriate length computing functions according to the type of characters involved (e.g., `strlen` for byte characters and `wcslen` for wide characters). Moreover, automated static analysis tools can help detect instances of this weakness in code by analyzing data and control flow to identify potentially vulnerable patterns linking input sources to unsafe data manipulations or memory allocations.

CWE-266, titled "Incorrect Privilege Assignment," pertains to vulnerabilities stemming from inappropriately assigning privileges to particular actors in software or systems, leading to unintended expansions of their control. This issue is classified as a "Base" type in the Common Weakness Enumeration framework, indicating a problem that, while somewhat generic, has enough specificity to guide detection and prevention efforts in a wide range of technology contexts. It is highlighted that incorrect privilege assignment can result in actors gaining access to restricted functionalities and sensitive information, potentially including administrative functions and user accounts. This problem can arise during the implementation phase as a consequence of failing to adequately secure architectural elements or not properly managing privileges. Mitigation strategies involve careful privilege management, employing the principle of least privilege, and environment hardening to limit the opportunities for exploitation. These strategies are crucial in preventing attackers from gaining unauthorised access or escalating their privileges within the system. Examples of this weakness include changing user IDs to that of a privileged user and sending broadcast intents that improperly grant access to sensitive data in Android applications. This CWE is linked to broader issues like improper privilege management and has real-world implications as demonstrated through associated CVE records, emphasizing its significance in software and hardware security.

CWE-212 relates to the improper removal of sensitive information before a resource is shared, transferred, or stored, making it accessible to unauthorized actors. This vulnerability pertains to any data-holding object, such as documents, packets, messages, or databases, that needs cleansing of sensitive content before it can be entrusted outside a specific authorized group. Examples of such oversight include document editing software that does not strip out potentially confidential reviewer comments or a proxy failing to remove internal IP addresses from headers in outgoing Internet requests. The base nature of this weakness signifies it is largely independent of specific technologies but with enough detail to guide towards detection and prevention measures.

This vulnerability is connected through a hierarchy of related weaknesses, suggesting it emerges primarily from broader mismanagement in resource transfer between different control spheres, with specific instances including failure to fully remove sensitive information during resource reuse and exposure of system data due to uncleared debug information. Mitigation strategies involve delineating private or sensitive data explicitly during the requirements phase, ensuring data compartmentalization in design to strengthen trust boundaries, implementing naming conventions and separation of sensitive from non-sensitive content, and avoiding improper resource shutdown or release errors. This weakness is crucial for consideration across various stages of the development lifecycle, including architecture, design, and implementation, emphasizing preventative measures for reducing the attack surface and reinforcing data privacy.

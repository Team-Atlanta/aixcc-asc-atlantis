CWE-184, known as "Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs," points to a prevalent security weakness where a software product employs a protection mechanism based on denying certain inputs or input properties due to policy restrictions or the need for neutralization before further processing. The core issue arises when the list of disallowed inputs is incomplete, making the system vulnerable to attacks exploiting the oversight. Developers often create these lists to block known harmful inputs, like specific special characters that trigger unintended commands. However, these lists typically cover only well-recognized threats, overlooking less common but potentially harmful inputs. As a result, attackers can identify and use these unexpected inputs to bypass the protection mechanism, posing a significant security risk.

This weakness illustrates a fundamental challenge in securing software systems: the difficulty of anticipating and blocking all possible harmful inputs. It underscores the limitation of relying solely on denylists or blocklists for security and highlights the importance of employing a more comprehensive and proactive approach to input validation. This approach should include allowing only known safe inputs and accurately encoding outputs to prevent exploitation. The weakness has various related issues and consequences, including bypassing access control mechanisms and leading to vulnerabilities in web applications, such as cross-site scripting and OS command injections, by exploiting the oversight in the input validation process. Mitigation strategies primarily involve thorough input validation techniques that go beyond simple denylisting to ensure a more robust defense against unexpected and malicious inputs.

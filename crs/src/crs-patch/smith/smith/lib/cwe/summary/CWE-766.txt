CWE-766 ("Critical Data Element Declared Public") details a vulnerability where a product makes a critical variable, field, or member public contrary to the intended security policy that requires it to be private. This weakness is categorized under the base level of abstraction, highlighting issues that, while fairly independent of specific resources or technologies, provide enough detail for detection and prevention methods. More specifically, making a critical data element public potentially complicates the maintenance of the product, affecting its security indirectly by making vulnerabilities harder to find or fix and possibly facilitating the introduction of further vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it allows for unauthorized access to or modification of critical data, which threatens the integrity and confidentiality of the application. The weakness is relevant across various programming languages like C++, C#, and Java. Mitigation involves declaring data as private, static, and final whenever possible to protect code by ensuring early instantiation, limiting access, and preventing tampering. This issue is tied to broader concepts such as insufficient encapsulation and incorrect permission assignments for critical resources, and it can significantly impact software maintainability and security.

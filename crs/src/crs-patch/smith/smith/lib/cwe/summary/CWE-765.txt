CWE-765 describes a vulnerability that occurs when a program unlocks a critical resource multiple times unintentionally, leading to an unexpected system state. This weakness typically manifests in concurrent environments where the handling of locks is crucial for maintaining system stability and security. Specifically, issues arise when a critical resource is unlocked more times than it is locked, which can lead to resource management problems such as an increase in the available count of pooled resources like semaphores. This erroneous count may then result in system crashes or unpredictable behavior, especially as the system approaches its capacity limits. The vulnerability touches on aspects like availability and integrity, imposing risks such as causing crashes, exits, or restarts, modifying memory, and leading to an unexpected state. Mitigation strategies emphasize the importance of balancing lock and unlock operations in the code to ensure that for every lock, there is a corresponding unlock, especially in scenarios where operations may fail or conditions change, requiring a reevaluation and potential reacquisition of the lock(s) before proceeding.

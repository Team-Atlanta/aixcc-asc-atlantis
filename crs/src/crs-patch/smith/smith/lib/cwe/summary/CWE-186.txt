CWE-186 addresses the issue of an overly restrictive regular expression, which occurs when a regular expression fails to match all intended values, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. This weakness is not associated with the complexity of the regular expression but with its failure to capture intended values, causing either false positives or false negatives. An illustrative example provided is the use of the expression /[0-8]/ with the intent to match any digit from 0 to 9. The omission of "9" from the match set due to the overly restrictive pattern could result in security-relevant values being missed. This issue, classified under the Base level of abstraction, is relevant across programming languages and is not specific to any single language. Mitigation strategies include simplifying complex regular expressions into several smaller ones, and applying rigorous testing methods like equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, and robustness testing. Despite thorough testing, developers are cautioned that no regular expression can be entirely foolproof and should be prepared to refine their expressions in response to new exploits. The categorization and discussions around CWE-186 also touch upon its relationship with other weaknesses and the implications for access control by potentially allowing the bypass of protection mechanisms.

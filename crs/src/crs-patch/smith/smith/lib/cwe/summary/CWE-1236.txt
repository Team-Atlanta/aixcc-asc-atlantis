CWE-1236 addresses the security weakness associated with the improper neutralization of formula elements in CSV files. When user-provided information is saved into a Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file without appropriately neutralizing special elements that could be interpreted as commands, there's a significant security risk. This issue is especially pertinent when the CSV file is opened with spreadsheet software like Excel, Numbers, or Calc, as these programs execute entries starting with '=' as formulas. This execution capability can be exploited by attackers to perform actions such as information exfiltration or other malicious activities by embedding formulas in the data saved to CSV files. They achieve this by taking advantage of the software's formula language, which might allow access to hyperlinks or the local command line, including the capacity to invoke entire scripts.


Mitigation strategies for this weakness involve ensuring that formula-sensitive metacharacters like '=', '+', '-', and '@' are either escaped or removed from data before its inclusion in CSV output. Another approach is to prepend formula characters in data fields with a single apostrophe, which prevents their execution as formulas in Excel. However, these strategies have varying degrees of effectiveness across different spreadsheet software. This vulnerability, identified by various CVE records, highlights the broad potential for exploitation across numerous platforms and necessitates vigilance in the implementation phase of software development, specifically around how CSV export features handle formula entries.

CWE-301 pertains to reflection attacks within authentication protocols, highlighting a significant security weakness where mutual authentication mechanisms are exploited. These attacks typically occur when a protocol, designed for mutual authentication by exchanging encrypted challenges using a pre-shared key, is undermined. Such vulnerabilities arise from the protocol's failure to distinctly authenticate each party, particularly when the same pre-shared key is used across different entities. Attackers exploit this by impersonating a legitimate user, tricking the system into authenticating them without the correct key. This is achieved through reflection attacks, which leverage the mutual authentication scheme's process of verifying a shared secret using a Diffie-Hellman-like method, without transmitting the secret in plaintext. By initiating multiple connections, attackers can request the hash of a value from the server, then use the server’s requested value in a new connection as the validation hash — effectively masquerading as the authenticated user. This type of attack underlines the crucial need for robust design in authentication protocols, emphasizing separate keys for each party or unique challenges, to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and identity assumption.

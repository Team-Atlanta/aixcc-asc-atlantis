CWE-1392 identifies the security weakness associated with the use of default credentials, such as passwords or cryptographic keys, particularly in software and hardware products. This weakness stems from the practice of assigning default authentication mechanisms to simplify manufacturing or deployment processes. However, if these default settings are not changed by system administrators upon installation, they pose a significant security risk, making it easier for attackers to bypass authentication measures and gain unauthorized access. This vulnerability is not specific to any language, operating system, technology, or architecture, indicating a broad potential impact across various platforms, including Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Technology (OT). The implications of exploiting this weakness can be severe, especially in critical industries like power, water, and electrical, where it could compromise not only data security but also operational safety.

Mitigation strategies for this weakness include prohibiting the use of default, hard-coded credentials during the requirements phase, and ensuring that administrators are forced to change these credentials during installation. Additional measures involve changing default credentials during product operation, with varying levels of effectiveness. Real-world examples illustrate the exploitation of this weakness in products from multiple vendors, leading to vulnerabilities that could potentially allow attackers to manipulate the operation of critical systems or decrypt SSL traffic. Given its base level of abstraction, CWE-1392 is crucial for understanding and mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities associated with the use of default credentials, providing a valuable reference point for developers, security researchers, and administrators aiming to enhance the security of software and hardware products.

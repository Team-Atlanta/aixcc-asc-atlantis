CWE-447, categorized as a "Base" level weakness, highlights a specific issue in the realm of user interfaces (UI) where a UI function, particularly one related to security features, appears to be supported, even giving feedback to users that suggest its support, yet the underlying functionality is not actually implemented. This discrepancy can lead to vulnerabilities as it might mislead users regarding the security features' efficacy, potentially impacting the application's overall security posture adversely. The challenge stems from the UI presenting options or features related to security that, despite their appearance, have not been developed or integrated into the backend, leading to a false sense of security among users and administrators. Examples of such vulnerabilities have been observed in various software, including GUI configuration tools and web browsers, where certain security settings or options were either not enabled as expected or did not modify security settings properly. Mitigations recommend engaging in thorough functionality testing before deployment to ensure all advertised features work as intended. Additionally, this CWE is mapped to broader categories, indicating it reflects on user interface security issues and violations of secure design principles, underscoring the importance of accurate UI representations of security functionalities.

This CWE speaks to a broader issue within software development and deploymentâ€”ensuring that user interfaces accurately reflect the capabilities and configurations of the underlying systems, especially concerning security features. It points to a gap between user expectations set by the UI and the actual security functionalities implemented, urging developers and security professionals to pay close attention to the coherence between UI indications and backend capabilities. Engaging in comprehensive testing phases that include verifying the implementation of all features, particularly security-related ones as suggested by the UI, is essential in mitigating such issues.

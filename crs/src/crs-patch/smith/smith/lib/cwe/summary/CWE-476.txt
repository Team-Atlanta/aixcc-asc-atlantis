The CWE-476 represents a null pointer dereference bug that occurs when a software application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is actually null, often leading to a crash or exit. The error is typically the result of flaws such as race conditions or programming omissions. It is associated with weaknesses resulting from improper checks for exceptional conditions or improper adherence to coding standards. The bug can lead to consequences such as Denial of service (crashes), unauthorized command execution, memory reading or modification if unhandled properly. Mitigation includes conscientious programming practices that involve sanity checks of all pointers before use, input validation, and using languages not susceptible to such issues.

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) ID 570 pertains to a security weakness that involves an expression in the code that consistently evaluates to false. This type of weakness is categorized as a base-level weakness, implying that while it is still largely independent of a specific resource or technology, it possesses detailed characteristics that aid in the identification and prevention of the issue. These weaknesses usually relate to a combination of behavior, property, technology, language, and resource dimensions. A classic manifestation of this weakness is through conditions in code that are intended for operations like updates or checks, but due to incorrect logic, such as wrongly assigned boolean values or misused bitwise operations, the conditions never fulfill their intended purpose. This can lead to severe consequences like unexecuted critical method calls, resulting in quality degradation or varied impacts depending on the context.

For example, in a flawed implementation, a method intended to validate and update product and account information in an inventory system may never execute the update due to the incorrect handling of validation flags. Similarly, misuse of bitwise AND/OR operations in defining access controls can systematically fail to evaluate access permissions correctly. These mistakes can introduce vulnerabilities in the software, making automated static analysis tools effective in detecting such issues by analyzing source or compiled code without execution. CWE-570 is a part of several broader categories within CWE related to expression issues, software development, and secure coding practices highlighted by different standards and mappings, emphasizing its relevance across a wide range of software engineering and security contexts.

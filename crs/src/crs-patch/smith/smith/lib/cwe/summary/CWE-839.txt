CWE-839: Numeric Range Comparison Without Minimum Check is defined as a weakness where a product fails to confirm that a numeric value falls within a minimum boundary, only verifying it does not exceed a maximum limit. This oversight can occur in situations where values are assumed to be positive by default, leading to potential security vulnerabilities if negative values are input. For instance, if such values are used in memory allocation, array or buffer access, they could provoke memory corruption, buffer overflow, or unexpected financial transactions in applications. For example, a shopping cart failing to check for minimum item quantities could inadvertently credit an attacker's account due to calculation errors with negative values. This issue is most commonly identified in C and C++ languages and poses substantial risks, including unauthorized code execution, modification of data, denial of service through resource consumption, and memory modification or access violations. Effective mitigation strategies include enforcing the use of unsigned variables when negative numbers are not anticipated and incorporating comprehensive input validation checks to ensure all numeric values fall within the expected positive range.

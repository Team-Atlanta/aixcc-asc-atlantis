CWE-628 addresses the weakness where a program calls a function, procedure, or routine with incorrectly specified arguments, leading to behavior that is consistently incorrect and potentially introduces further vulnerabilities. This can manifest through a variety of mistakes, such as using the wrong variable or reference, providing an incorrect number of arguments, misordering arguments, passing arguments of the wrong type, or giving arguments the wrong value. These errors can lead to unintended behavior in software, potentially causing quality degradation or allowing attackers to gain unauthorized privileges or access. The root of the problem lies in the basic implementation phase of software development and affects all languages, as it is not specific to any single programming language. Common consequences include technical impacts like quality degradation and compromised access control, opening up the system to further weaknesses and exploits by attackers. Examples provided illustrate how such mistakes in argument specification can lead to authentication bypasses, failure to exit after failed authentication, and incorrect access control decisions. Mitigating these issues involves careful code inspection, utilization of compiler features and code inspection tools to identify potential violations, and ensuring API stability before production use.

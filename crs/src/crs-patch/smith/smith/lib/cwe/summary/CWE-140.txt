CWE-140 involves the improper neutralization of delimiters in a product, a base level weakness that can lead to various security vulnerabilities if not properly addressed. This weakness occurs when a software or hardware product fails to correctly neutralize special characters (delimiters) that separate data elements within a sequence, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the data or execute unintended commands. Delimiters can include characters or sequences of characters used to separate elements within data, such as commas, spaces, or specialized format characters. CWE-140 is related to several variant weaknesses, each focusing on specific types of delimiters like parameter/argument, value, record, line, section, and expression/command delimiters. The common consequence of exploiting this weakness is causing the system to reach an unexpected state, compromising data integrity. Examples of real-world vulnerabilities include insertion of field separators to gain admin privileges or manipulate input to interfere with program logic. Mitigation strategies primarily involve rigorous input validation to ensure only valid and expected input is processed, including the use of allowlists/denylists and careful handling of input to avoid double decoding or improper filtering that attackers could exploit. Proper output encoding and argument sanitization are also critical in preventing delimiter-related issues.

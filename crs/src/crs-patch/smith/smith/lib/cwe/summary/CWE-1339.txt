CWE-1339 identifies a security weakness where the processing of a real number does not preserve the required accuracy and precision in its fractional part, leading to incorrect results. This flaw is significant in scenarios requiring highly precise calculations, such as financial computations or pricing, where minor inaccuracies can be exploited. The limitation stems from various methods of storing the fractional part of real numbers in computing systems, each with inherent accuracy constraints. These constraints may arise due to the fixed number of digits for representation, leading to insufficient detail for accurate representation, or the inability to represent repeating or irrational numbers precisely due to their nature. This inaccuracy can manifest in calculations drifting from expected outcomes, potentially causing overflow, underflow, or other unintended behaviors. Real-world implications of such inaccuracies include failures in critical systems, as seen in historical incidents where miscalculations have led to significant financial losses or even loss of life. The enumeration suggests mitigations such as utilizing more precise representations of real numbers or employing ratios of large integers for enhanced precision, albeit with considerations for performance trade-offs since such measures may require additional computational resources.

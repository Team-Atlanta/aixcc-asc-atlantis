CWE-129, titled "Improper Validation of Array Index," pertains to an issue where a product uses untrusted input to calculate or determine an array index without properly validating or incorrectly validating the index to guarantee it references a valid position within the array. This specific weakness, which can occur at the variant level of abstraction and is linked with distinct products that involves particular languages or technologies, highlights a common programming error related to array index handling. The incorrect handling of array indices can manifest through various forms such as out-of-bounds array index, index-out-of-range, and array index underflow. These issues can result in a range of consequences like denial of service (DoS) through crashes or exits, unauthorized modification or reading of memory outside the intended array bounds, which may compromise the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system. Furthermore, such vulnerabilities could potentially lead to the execution of unauthorized code or commands if the out-of-bounds access grants an attacker influence over the executable memory. The array index validation problem is frequently illustrated through various programming languages showing the outcomes of failure to properly check array index ranges. Techniques to mitigate this weakness involve input validation strategies, adopting languages or constructs that either automatically manage array bounds or provide mechanisms to easily validate array indices, utilizing environment hardening features such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) to complicate exploitation, and ensuring that software runs with the least privileges necessary.

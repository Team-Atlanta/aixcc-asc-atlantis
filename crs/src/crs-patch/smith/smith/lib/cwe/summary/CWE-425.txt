CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') is a vulnerability that arises when a web application does not properly enforce authorization on restricted URLs, scripts, or files. Such web applications operate under the false assumption that resources can only be accessed through specific navigation paths and neglect to apply authorization checks at all points. This oversight enables attackers to bypass intended access controls by crafting direct requests to sensitive areas, potentially leading to unauthorized information disclosure, data modification, or execution of unauthorized commands. The essence of this issue is the failure to adequately secure all parts of an application from unauthorized direct access, which could lead to a wide array of security breaches including but not limited to authentication bypasses and unauthorized data access. The relationships section reveals that this weakness is closely associated with other vulnerabilities such as authentication bypass using an alternative path or channel, improper protection of an alternate path, and missing authorization. To mitigate this vulnerability, applying appropriate access control authorizations for each access to all restricted resources and employing MVC frameworks like Struts for more robust security architecture are recommended.

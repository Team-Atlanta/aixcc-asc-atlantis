CWE-223, titled "Omission of Security-relevant Information", refers to the improper handling or neglect in recording or displaying security-related information which is significant for identifying an attack's source or nature, or determining the safety of an action. This kind of weakness arises from the base level of abstraction, meaning it is sufficiently independent of specific technologies or resources but still detailed enough to offer methods for detection and prevention. It is categorized under "Information Loss or Omission" and is closely related to issues like "Insufficient Logging". The omission can occur at various phases such as architecture and design, implementation, or operation, primarily due to missing security measures or tactics. The consequences of this weakness can significantly impact the system's non-repudiation capability by making the origin of an attack difficult or impossible to trace, which in turn allows malicious activities to persist undetected. Demonstrative examples include scenarios where failed login attempts are not adequately logged or where crucial information, like the real file name in a file access attempt, is not recorded. This could enable attackers to hide their activities and evade detection. The omission of security-relevant information is recognized in key references and frameworks, including its mention in the OWASP Top Ten list as part of "Insufficient Logging & Monitoring" and "Security Logging and Monitoring Failures".

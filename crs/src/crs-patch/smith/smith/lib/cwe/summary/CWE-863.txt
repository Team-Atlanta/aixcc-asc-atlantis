CWE-863 refers to an Incorrect Authorization security bug where the software performs an authorization check when a user tries to access a resource or perform an action but fails to correctly perform the check, thereby allowing attackers to bypass intended access restrictions. Incorrect authorization can result in unauthorized access to data, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution. This flaw may arise during the conversion of a single-user application to a multi-user environment or due to a developer's lack of understanding of underlying technologies, such as assuming that attackers cannot modify certain inputs. Mitigation strategies include dividing the product into various authorization areas, ensuring business logic-related access control checks, using vetted authorization frameworks, and establishing "default deny" policy in access control lists. Automated static analysis can detect common authorization idioms but struggles with custom schemes; manual analysis can effectively evaluate custom authorization mechanisms.

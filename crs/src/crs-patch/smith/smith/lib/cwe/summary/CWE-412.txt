CWE-412, "Unrestricted Externally Accessible Lock," details a security weakness where a software or hardware product checks for the existence of a lock but fails to ensure the lock cannot be externally controlled or influenced by unauthorized actors. This vulnerability primarily concerns the inability to maintain exclusive control over locks, such as mutexes or shared resources treated as locks, leading to potential misuse. Such a flaw could prevent the system from performing intended actions on associated resources or executing certain behaviors dictated by the lock's presence. The essence of this vulnerability is the risk of indefinite denial of service (DoS) if a lock can be perpetually held by an attacker, essentially preventing legitimate access or operation. This weakness is also characterized by its relationships with other CWEs, notably as a child of Improper Locking (CWE-667) and potentially related to Insufficient Resource Pool (CWE-410). Effective mitigation strategies include employing access control mechanisms provided by the locking function, generating unpredictable names for locks, and considering non-blocking synchronization methods to avoid such vulnerabilities. This weakness's detection can be challenging, as it often requires understanding the specific application context and the security model to identify critical resource locks accurately.

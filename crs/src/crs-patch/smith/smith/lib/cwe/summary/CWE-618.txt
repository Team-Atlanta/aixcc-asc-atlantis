CWE-618 details a specific weakness in ActiveX controls that are intended for use within web browsers but inadvertently expose unsafe methods, potentially acting outside the browser's established security mechanisms (e.g., zones or domains). This vulnerability stems from the excessive system control ActiveX can wield, far surpassing that of Java or JavaScript. The crux of this vulnerability lies in the exposed methods, which may harbor a variety of susceptibilities based on the nature of the executed behaviors, especially if input validation checks are neglected on the provided arguments. Such oversights can enable attackers to invoke these methods without proper integrity or origin validation, posing a significant security risk. This issue is categorized as a Variant level weakness, indicating it is tied to specific technologies or languages and concrete enough to outline detection and prevention methods yet is less generic than a Base level weakness. The ramifications of exploiting this vulnerability range from unauthorized actions within the OS to potential privacy breaches. Mitigation strategies emphasize thorough input validation for any exposed methods, cautious designation of controls as safe for scripting, and, where applicable, employing code signing to verify authenticity though this does not negate existing control weaknesses.

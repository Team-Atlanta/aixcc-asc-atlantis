CWE-260 focuses on the security risk associated with storing passwords in configuration files, a common yet critical oversight in software and hardware systems. This weakness involves the improper storage of sensitive information, where passwords are placed within configuration files that may be accessible to unauthorized users or actors. Such an approach exposes systems to various security threats, as attackers gaining access to these configuration files can easily retrieve, and potentially modify, the stored passwords. This could lead to unauthorized access and control over the system, data breaches, and a compromise of security protocols. The vulnerability spans across various platforms and languages, indicating its widespread relevance and the need for careful consideration during the architecture, design, and implementation phases of development. Mitigation strategies include avoiding the storage of passwords in plaintext within easily accessible locations and instead, employing cryptographic methods such as hashing for storing sensitive information. Detection of this vulnerability can be effectively performed through automated static analysis, demonstrating high effectiveness in identifying instances where passwords are improperly stored within configuration files.

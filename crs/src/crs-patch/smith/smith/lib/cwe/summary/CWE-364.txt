CWE-364 describes a vulnerability related to signal handler race conditions, where the use of signal handlers that support asynchronous actions can lead to various security issues due to the concurrent execution environment they create. This vulnerability arises when non-reentrant functions or actions sensitive to the state of execution are used within a signal handler, potentially leading to race conditions. These conditions can cause the application's state to be corrupted, potentially allowing attackers to cause a denial of service or even execute arbitrary code. The root of the problem often lies in shared state between the signal handler and regular code or between multiple signal handlers, the use of non-reentrant functions like `malloc()` and `free()` within signal handlers, and the association of a signal handler with multiple signals. Vulnerabilities may also arise from the use of functions like `setjmp` and `longjmp` that prevent a signal handler from returning control back to the original code.

Mitigation strategies involve avoiding shared states, employing synchronization in both signal handlers and regular code, and ensuring signal handlers perform minimal and safe operations, primarily setting flags for later checking in the main program loop. The vulnerability is particularly relevant to C and C++ due to the common prevalence of these issues in applications written in these languages. Consequences of exploiting such vulnerabilities can include unauthorized data or command execution, privilege escalation, and denial of service. To reduce the risk of exploitation, developers are encouraged to use reentrant functions within signal handlers and validate the consistency of shared states during signal handling.

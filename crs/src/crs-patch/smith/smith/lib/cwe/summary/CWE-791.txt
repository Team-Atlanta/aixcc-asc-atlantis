CWE-791 describes a security weakness where a product receives data from an upstream component but fails to fully filter special elements before sending it to a downstream component. This base-level weakness is critical in understanding and preventing specific security vulnerabilities as it leads to incomplete neutralization of potentially malicious elements in data. The severity of this weakness is underscored by its parent and child relationships with other weaknesses, such as CWE-790 (Improper Filtering of Special Elements) and CWE-792 (Incomplete Filtering of One or More Instances of Special Elements), indicating its foundational role in the hierarchy of data filtering issues. A practical example provided highlights how this weakness can be exploited: a Perl script that inadequately filters "../" from user input, leading to a path traversal vulnerability because it fails to remove all instances, thereby allowing an attacker to access restricted files. This CWE entry is a crucial point of reference for tool developers, security researchers, and pen-testers focused on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities related to improper data sanitization.

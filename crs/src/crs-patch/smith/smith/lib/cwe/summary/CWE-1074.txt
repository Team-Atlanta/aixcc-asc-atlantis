The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE-1074) addresses the security weakness associated with a class that has excessively deep inheritance, characterized by a large number of parent classes. This structural complexity can significantly impact the maintainability and understandability of the software, indirectly affecting its security. Excessively deep inheritance complicates the task of finding and fixing vulnerabilities due to the increased intricacy, and it may also facilitate the inadvertent introduction of additional vulnerabilities. The Center for Internet Security Quality (CISQ) suggests maintaining inheritance to a default maximum of 7 parent classes to mitigate this issue. While CWE-1074 is chiefly a quality concern rather than a direct security vulnerability, its existence can indirectly lead to security-relevant weaknesses by making them harder to detect or easier to introduce.

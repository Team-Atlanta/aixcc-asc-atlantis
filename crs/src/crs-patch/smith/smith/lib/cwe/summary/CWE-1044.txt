CWE-1044 addresses an architectural design issue where the number of horizontal layers in a product's architecture is outside the recommended range, making the product difficult to maintain. This difficulty arises because having too few or too many layers can complicate the process of finding and fixing vulnerabilities, possibly leading to an increased chance of introducing new vulnerabilities. The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) suggests that an architecture should ideally have a minimum of four layers and a maximum of eight to maintain a balance that supports easier maintenance and security. This weakness is characterized as an indirect issue that may not directly impact security but can lead to practices that make security vulnerabilities more likely or harder to address. Identified under the base level of abstraction, CWE-1044 is crucial for developers, security researchers, and tool developers for understanding and preventing architectural weaknesses that indirectly affect a product's security posture by influencing maintainability.

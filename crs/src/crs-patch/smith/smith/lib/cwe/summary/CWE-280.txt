CWE-280, titled "Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or Privileges," focuses on vulnerabilities arising from systems that do not correctly manage operations when there are insufficient privileges to access resources or functionalities as defined by their permissions settings. This oversight or error can lead to the system following unexpected code paths, possibly resulting in the system entering an invalid state. As a base-level weakness, it provides enough detail to aid in detection and prevention methods across various dimensions, including behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. This issue can emerge during the implementation phase as a result of not adequately realizing architectural security tactics, affecting a wide range of languages and not being specific to any single language. The negative impacts of exploiting such a vulnerability include altered execution logic among other potential harms. Mitigation strategies include segregating the system into safe areas with clearly defined trust boundaries, applying the principle of least privilege during the design phase to decide when to use or drop privileges and ensuring robust error checking and handling during implementation, even when operating under highly privileged modes. This CWE is critical in understanding the challenges in fine-grained permission and privilege models and highlights the necessity for developers and system architects to anticipate access failures to strengthen security measures.

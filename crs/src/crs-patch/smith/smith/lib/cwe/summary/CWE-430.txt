CWE-430 addresses the security weakness related to the deployment of the wrong handler for processing an object, a base-level weakness which means it exhibits issues across several dimensions such as behavior, property, and technology. This issue may arise in various forms, such as invoking a servlet mistakenly to reveal the source code of a .JSP file or misidentifying an object's type contrary to its explicitly specified type. It belongs to a category of errors classified under "Handler Errors" and is linked with insufficient control flow management. This error can lead to various consequences, predominantly affecting the integrity and other areas depending on the specific context, potentially leading to an unexpected state of the system.

Mitigation strategies focus primarily on architecture and design phases, advocating for performing type checks before interpreting an object and rejecting inconsistent types, exemplified by a file having a misleading extension that contradicts its actual content. CWE-430 serves as a resultant weakness rather than a direct vulnerability, indicating its role in possibly facilitating other security weaknesses. It has relationships with other CWE entries like Insufficient Control Flow Management and is categorized under significant listings, including OWASP's Top Ten 2021 Category A04:2021 - Insecure Design. Proper handling and mapping of this weakness, by considering its base level of abstraction, are critical for addressing root causes of related vulnerabilities.

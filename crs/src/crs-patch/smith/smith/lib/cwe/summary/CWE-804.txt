**Summary of CWE-804: Guessable CAPTCHA**

CWE-804 identifies a weakness where a CAPTCHA challenge, designed to determine whether a user is human, can be guessed or automatically recognized by a non-human actor (such as bots). This vulnerability can enable an automated attacker to bypass the CAPTCHA's protection mechanisms, potentially allowing for unauthorized actions to be carried out at a higher frequency than would be possible by a human, such as spam or automated data extraction attacks. The essence of this weakness lies in the predictability or insufficient complexity of the CAPTCHA challenges. Examples of such weaknesses include audio or visual CAPTCHAs with minimal distortion, easily recognizable question formats (like basic math questions), questions with a limited range of answers, general knowledge questions easily answered through database lookup, or CAPTCHAs where ancillary data (like an image's filename) hints at the solution. The implications of exploiting this weakness are significant, as it may allow bypassing of critical security mechanisms that rely on CAPTCHA to ensure human-only access, leading to unauthorized access or actions within a system. This weakness, not specific to any language or technology but sometimes prevalent in web server technologies, is crucial for entities relying on CAPTCHAs for security to understand and mitigate.

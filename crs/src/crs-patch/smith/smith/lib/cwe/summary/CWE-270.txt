CWE-270, labeled as Privilege Context Switching Error, identifies a weakness where a software product fails to properly manage privileges during the transition between different contexts that possess distinct privileges or control spheres. This base level abstraction weakness, which stands out due to its relatively specific yet independent nature from a resource or technology, points to issues in behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. It arises predominantly during the implementation phase as a result of not correctly implementing an architectural security tactic, but it can also surface during operation. The consequence of this weakness is significantâ€”exploitation allows unauthorized access, enabling an attacker to gain privileges, assume identities of other users, or access sensitive information belonging to others. Mitigation strategies, therefore, emphasize careful management of privileges, such as running code with the lowest necessary privileges, environment hardening, and adhering to the principle of separation of privilege. CWE-270 is broadly applicable across different platforms and languages due to its non-language-specific nature, revealing a need for heightened awareness and preventive measures across the software development and operational lifecycle to combat this vulnerability.

CWE-825, known as Expired Pointer Dereference, is a vulnerability that involves the incorrect use of memory pointers. When a program frees memory but fails to invalidate the pointer to that memory, the pointer remains active, or "dangling." If this dangling pointer is subsequently dereferenced for reading or writing data, it can lead to the program interacting with memory that has been reallocated for other purposes. This mishandling can cause various issues, such as denial of service, information leakage, or even arbitrary code execution, depending on how the reclaimed memory is utilized by the application. The vulnerability is a base-level weakness, indicative of fundamental software issues that can manifest in various scenarios. Common scenarios include using a pointer after it has been freed (resulting in use-after-free vulnerabilities), double-free errors, or when pointers are manipulated or dereferenced without adequate checks. Mitigation strategies emphasize the use of programming languages that manage memory automatically and setting pointers to NULL after freeing them, reducing the chance of misuse. However, the effectiveness of these strategies can be diminished in complex software systems with intricate pointer and data structure use.

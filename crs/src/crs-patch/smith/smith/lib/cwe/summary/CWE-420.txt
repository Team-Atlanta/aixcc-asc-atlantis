CWE-420, labeled as "Unprotected Alternate Channel," outlines a vulnerability that surfaces when a product secures its primary communication channel but neglects to apply the same level of protection to an alternative channel. This base-level weakness points to a scenario where although one path for data exchange or command execution is well-guarded against unauthorized access, another path—which might offer similar access or control—lacks sufficient security measures. This disparity in protection can lead to scenarios where malicious entities exploit the less secure alternate channel to bypass security mechanisms that are in place for the primary channel, potentially gaining privileges or assuming identity by bypassing access control measures. The essence of this weakness lies in the oversight during the architecture and design phase, where security considerations fail to encompass all possible pathways through which data or commands might flow, leading to an inconsistent security posture across different channels within a system.

Demonstrative examples provided include a case where two registers, one secured and its replicate unsecured, allow for an attacker to exploit the unprotected alternate channel to modify secure data. Mitigation strategies emphasize the need for identifying all potential communication channels during the design phase and ensuring that each is covered by corresponding security mechanisms, aiming for a uniform protection level across all channels. This deficiency is relevant to various operational contexts and has been linked to numerous CVE records showing real-world exploitations, such as indirect access to protected flash memory via an instruction bus or bypassing database restrictions by querying directly. Hence, a comprehensive security strategy must address the uniform protection of all communication channels to prevent exploitation through less obvious, alternate pathways.

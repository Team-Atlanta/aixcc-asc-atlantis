CWE-916 identifies a security weakness where a hashing scheme used for password storage does not require sufficient computational effort, making it vulnerable to password cracking attacks. This insufficient computational intensity allows attackers to efficiently compute hashes and potentially crack passwords if they can access the stored hash values, such as through a SQL injection attack. This vulnerability arises because many hashing algorithms, designed to be fast and low-overhead, inadvertently facilitate attackers' efforts by allowing them to quickly generate large numbers of hashes using powerful parallel computing resources. Effective countermeasures should involve increasing the computational effort required for hashing through techniques such as "stretching" (increasing CPU time per hash), employing "memory-hard" operations (requiring more memory per hash computation), and integrating a unique "salt" with each password before hashing to prevent the use of precomputed hash tables like rainbow tables. Salting also ensures that each hash is unique, thereby thwarting attempts to use the same pre-computed hash to crack multiple passwords. It is crucial that the chosen hash scheme is robust against all potential attack vectors, taking into account the specific security needs of the environment where it is deployed. Techniques such as bcrypt, scrypt, and PBKDF2 are recommended for their capability to adaptively increase the workload for brute-force attacks, making them more secure against modern cracking techniques.

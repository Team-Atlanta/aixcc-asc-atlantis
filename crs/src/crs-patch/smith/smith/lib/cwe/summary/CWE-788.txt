CWE-788 describes a security vulnerability that occurs when a product reads from or writes to a buffer by using an index or pointer that references a memory location beyond the end of the buffer. This issue typically happens when a pointer or its index is incorrectly incremented beyond the buffer's limit or due to incorrect pointer arithmetic, leading the pointer to reference a location outside the intended buffer space. The vulnerability is abstracted at the base level, indicating it is somewhat independent of specific technologies but detailed enough to guide the detection and prevention of such weaknesses.

The consequences of this vulnerability can vary, impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability. An attacker might exploit CWE-788 to read sensitive information from memory, modify memory contents, or execute unauthorized code, potentially leading to information disclosure, crashes (Denial of Service), or complete control over affected systems. This weakness is related to several other CWE entries, including buffer overflow variants and buffer over-read, underlining its pivotal role in buffer-related security issues. Demonstrative examples in the description highlight various scenarios where this vulnerability might manifest, such as improper size validation before buffer operations and assumptions about buffer contents size, leading to potential overflows or over-reads. Detection methods like fuzz testing and automated static analysis are deemed highly effective for identifying such vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for rigorous testing and code analysis practices to prevent exploitation.

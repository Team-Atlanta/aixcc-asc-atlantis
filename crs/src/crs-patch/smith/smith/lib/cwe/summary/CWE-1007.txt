CWE-1007 addresses a vulnerability arising from insufficient visual distinction of homoglyphs presented to users. Homoglyphs are visually similar or identical glyphs, pictures, or icons that can be distinct to a program but appear almost the same to a human user, leading to potential misinterpretation. This issue, relevant across various platforms and languages but particularly prevalent in web-based technologies, can significantly impact the integrity and confidentiality of information. Cyber adversaries exploit these similarities for phishing, creating deceptive links or usernames that mimic those of trusted entities to redirect users to malicious sites or obfuscate malicious activities in logs. For instance, the use of Cyrillic characters in place of ASCII characters in URLs can trick users into visiting attacker-controlled sites, believing them to be legitimate. Similarly, adversaries might craft usernames with homoglyphs to masquerade as legitimate users, complicating the tracking and attribution of actions in system logs. The primary mitigation strategies involve leveraging browser and email client functionalities that highlight or restrict the mixing of character sets, thereby guarding against these attacks by promoting clearer, less ambiguous visual distinctions among glyphs.

CWE-842, classified under the Common Weakness Enumeration, identifies a security weakness wherein a product or an administrator incorrectly assigns a user to a group. This misplacement can result in the user gaining access to more privileges or access rights than intended. Such an error in group assignment can undermine the security policies of a system by allowing users to access resources or perform actions beyond their rightful permissions, potentially without detection by the access-control system. This base-level weakness, significant for its practical implications in bypassing intended security measures, is a critical concern for ensuring proper access control and preventing unauthorized privilege escalation or access. Instances of this weakness have been observed in various real-world applications, ranging from operating systems to content management systems (CMS), where improper group assignments led to unauthorized gain of privileges or access. This summary encapsulates the essence of CWE-842, highlighting its impact on security policies and the necessity for vigilant management of user group assignments to safeguard against unintended security breaches.

CWE-941 pertains to the incorrect specification of destination in communication channels within software systems, which can lead to severe security issues if attackers exploit it. This type of vulnerability arises when an outgoing request to an actor is initiated through a communication channel, but the target destination is inaccurately determined. This flaw allows attackers to potentially spoof trusted servers, leading to the theft of data or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The root of this vulnerability can be twofold: firstly, if attackers are able to manipulate the destination of the communication, they can redirect the connection to malicious or untrusted destinations. For instance, utilizing connectionless protocols like UDP enables spoofing by falsifying the source address in packets, misleading the server into sending replies to incorrect destinations, which can be used for obfuscating attack origins or launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Secondly, if the destination is incorrectly specified due to misconfiguration or other weaknesses (such as faulty parsing of input leading to sending data to wrong destinations, or Android applications inadvertently sharing restricted data through sticky broadcasts), attackers could impersonate trusted servers. Examples of practical exploitations include the amplification attack via spoofed UDP source addresses and DNS queries inducing higher traffic to spoofed addresses. To defend against such vulnerabilities, understanding and correct implementation of communication channel security practices are paramount.

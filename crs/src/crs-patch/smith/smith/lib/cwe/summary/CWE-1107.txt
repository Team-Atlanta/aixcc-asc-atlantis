The CWE-1107 weakness pertains to the insufficient isolation of symbolic constant definitions within source code. This weakness arises when the definitions of symbolic constants are not adequately centralized or isolated, complicating the maintenance of the software. This lack of isolation can indirectly impact security by making vulnerabilities harder to identify and fix, and potentially facilitating the introduction of new vulnerabilities. The weakness is considered a base level issue, meaning it is somewhat independent of specific resources or technologies but detailed enough to outline specific methods for detection and prevention. It is categorized under poor coding practices and mainly affects maintainability by potentially making security-relevant weaknesses harder to detect or indirectly easier to introduce. CWE-1107 is also listed as a quality issue with indirect security implications, emphasizing the importance of proper coding practices in maintaining software security and integrity.

CWE-190 refers to the vulnerability known as an Integer Overflow or Wraparound, deriving from a computational error within a product. This occurs when a calculation produces an integer that is larger than the system is capable of storing in its associated representation. Consequently, the value may wrap around and become significantly small or negative. While under certain circumstances this behavior could be intended, it usually leads to unexpected and potentially harmful consequences, particularly if the overflow can be triggered using user-inputs. This becomes a security issue, especially when the result is used in loop control, security decisions, or in determining the offset or size related to behaviors like memory allocation, copying, etc. This can lead to other weaknesses such as out-of-bounds problems and memory corruption, which in turn could cause crashes, infinite loops, or even execution of unauthorized code.

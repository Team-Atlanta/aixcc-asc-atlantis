CWE-641 describes the security vulnerability arising from improper restriction of names for files and other resources. This vulnerability occurs when a system or application constructs the name of a file or resource based on input from an external source without adequately restricting or validating that input. This lack of restriction can lead to a variety of security issues depending on the context in which these resource names are used. For example, if resource names include scripting characters, they could potentially execute malicious scripts in a client's browser when displayed on a web page. Similarly, specially crafted resource names might exploit vulnerabilities in application parsers, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-641 and is a Base level weakness that can be mapped to real-world vulnerabilities. It is part of broader categories including Data Validation Issues, Data Neutralization Issues, and Resource Management Errors. Mitigation strategies involve not allowing user-controlled resource names on the server side, performing allowlist input validation, and ensuring technologies consuming the resources are secure against exploitations like buffer overflow or format string vulnerabilities. This vulnerability is recognized for its potential to compromise the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of systems, with specific consequences including unauthorized code execution, application data disclosure, and service denial.

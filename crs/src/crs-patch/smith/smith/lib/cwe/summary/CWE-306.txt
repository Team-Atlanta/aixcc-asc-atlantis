The CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function implies that the software does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources. As data transitions to the cloud, a lack of required authentication can simplify unauthorized access to this data over the Internet. Missed authentication could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, administrative privileges, and even possibilities for execution of arbitrary code. Effective mitigation strategies include separating the software into different areas, depending on authorization needs, ensuring all communication channels are proteced, duplicating client-side security checks on the server side, and using vetted libraries or frameworks. Detecting this type of weakness can be achieved through manual analysis as well as automated static and dynamic analysis methods.

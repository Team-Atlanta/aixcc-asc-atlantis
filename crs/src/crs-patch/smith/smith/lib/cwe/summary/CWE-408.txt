CWE-408, labeled as "Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Amplification," refers to a vulnerability wherein a product allows an entity to carry out a legitimate but resource-intensive operation before proper authentication or authorization checks are conducted. This flaw is categorized at the base level of abstraction, meaning it is relatively detailed and specific, potentially affecting various resources or technologies. This weakness can manifest itself in numerous ways, but predominantly it leads to excessive consumption of system resources (e.g., CPU, memory) potentially causing a denial of service (DoS) through system performance degradation or system crashes. An illustrative example given demonstrates a scenario where a PHP function inefficiently reads a file into memory before checking if a user is authorized to view the file, unnecessarily consuming resources when unauthorized access is attempted. This vulnerability is part of a broader class of weaknesses related to asymmetric resource consumption (amplification) and incorrect behavior order, and it shares relationships with other weaknesses that could lead to behavioral problems in software development. The CWE entry advises on the importance of proper mapping to real-world vulnerabilities, highlighting its suitability for capturing the root causes of such security issues due to its base level abstraction.

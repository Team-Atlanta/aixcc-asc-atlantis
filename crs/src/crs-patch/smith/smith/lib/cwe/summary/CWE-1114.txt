CWE-1114, identified as "Inappropriate Whitespace Style," points to the issue where a source code’s whitespace usage is inconsistent or deviates from the expected standards for the product. Being categorized as a base-level weakness, it does provide enough details to suggest specific methods for detection and prevention. This weakness primarily complicates the readability and maintenance of the product, indirectly impacting security by making the identification and rectification of vulnerabilities more challenging or time-consuming. Additionally, it might inadvertently simplify the process of introducing vulnerabilities into the code. Although CWE-1114 is essentially a quality concern without direct security implications, it’s been advised not to use this particular CWE ID for mapping real-world vulnerabilities due to its nature as more of a coding standard issue than a direct security threat. The entry underscores quality issues over direct security implications and guides towards focusing on more specific unsafe behaviors with clearer security consequences.

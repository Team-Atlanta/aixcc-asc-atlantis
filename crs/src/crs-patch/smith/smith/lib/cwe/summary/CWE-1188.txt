CWE-1188 concerns the initialization of a resource with an insecure default value, a common weakness where products are set up with default configurations intended for later adjustment by administrators. This practice, aimed at making products more user-friendly out of the box, often compromises security when these insecure defaults are not altered. The weakness is described at a base level of abstraction, highlighting that while it encompasses broad behavior and properties, it also provides enough detail for specific detection and prevention methods. This weakness underlines the risk of choosing convenience over security in product design and underscores the importance of administrators changing defaults to secure settings.

Demonstrative examples include issues like uninitialized variables in PHP, where the failure to explicitly initialize a variable like `$authorized` to `false` can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access if certain PHP settings (e.g., `register_globals`) are enabled. Fixes involve explicitly defining variables and ensuring safe defaults. Real-world observations such as CVE-2022-36349 and CVE-2022-42467 also illustrate the practical implications of this weakness, affecting everything from BIOS firmware to database interfaces with insecure default configurations leading to vulnerabilities like denial of service or unauthorized database access. This CWE entry emphasizes the critical balance between ease of use and security, urging for secure initialization practices to mitigate potential exploits.

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entry CWE-921 highlights a security vulnerability relating to the improper storage of sensitive data in mechanisms that lack adequate access control. This base-level weakness occurs when sensitive information is stored in a file system or device without built-in mechanisms to limit who can read or write data. Modern file systems and devices often come with some form of access control to restrict data access. However, not all storage mechanisms are equipped with such security measures. Common examples include memory cards, floppy disks, CDs, and USB devices, which may be accessible to anyone using the system. This poses a significant security risk in multi-user environments where unauthorized individuals could easily access, modify, or delete sensitive data. The issue is also evident in Android devices, where external storage areas are generally accessible by all apps installed on the device, as well as through USB connections or physical access to the device's memory card slot. The vulnerability underscores the necessity of incorporating secure access controls in the architecture and design phase to safeguard sensitive information from unauthorized access and modifications.

CWE-841, titled "Improper Enforcement of Behavioral Workflow," is a security vulnerability stemming from a system's failure to adequately enforce the order of operations in multistep processes. This flaw exists in the base level of software or hardware operation where behaviors, steps, or actions must occur in a specified sequence to maintain security or proper functionality. When a system does not verify or enforce this sequence, an attacker can potentially exploit this by performing actions out of the intended order or omitting necessary steps, leading to manipulation of business logic or the system entering an invalid or unintended state. For example, a file-sharing protocol might require a user to first provide a username and then a password before allowing file transfers. If the server accepts a password and transfer command without first receiving a valid username, it might improperly proceed with the transfer, exposing the system to unauthorized access or data leakage. This vulnerability is categorized under "Insufficient Control Flow Management" and relates closely to business logic errors and user session errors, indicating its potential to bypass intended security mechanisms by exploiting the logical flow of applications.

The consequences of such a vulnerability include alteration of execution logic, where an attacker might bypass critical security checks or perform unauthorized actions by exploiting the improper sequence handling. It's introduced during the implementation phase of development and often results from a lack of attention to the logical sequence that user actions should follow. This vulnerability underscores the complexity and importance of correctly implementing control flows within software and hardware systems to maintain security integrity and prevent exploitation through logic manipulation.

CWE-342 details a vulnerability concerning the predictability of an exact value or number based on observing previous values, which is a base-level weakness that spans across multiple dimensions like behavior, property, and technology but remains largely independent of specific resources or technologies. This weakness is related to the generation of predictable numbers or identifiers, indicating a broader class of vulnerabilities where the predictability can lead to security breaches. Examples of real-world exploitations include spoofing connections through predictable initial sequence numbers, allocating listening TCP ports sequentially to facilitate spoofing attacks, and the use of predictable TCP sequence numbers and DNS resolver IDs for spoofing purposes. Mitigation strategies emphasize increasing the entropy in the seeding of Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNGs), using high-quality entropy sources for re-seeding, and compliance with standards like FIPS 140-2 to avoid obvious entropy problems. This vulnerability is critical in the context of software development and is associated with randomness issues, underscoring the importance of unpredictability in maintaining secure systems.

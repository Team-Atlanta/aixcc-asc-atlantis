CWE-1085 identifies a specific weakness where a code element (such as a function, method, or procedure) contains an excessive volume of commented-out code within its body. This issue is considered a base level weakness as it is relatively independent of the specific technology or resource but detailed enough to suggest methods for detection and prevention. The primary consequence of this weakness is the increased difficulty in maintaining the product, which can indirectly impact security by complicating the process of identifying and fixing vulnerabilities. It may also inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities. An "excessive volume" of commented-out code is somewhat subjective but is generally recommended by CISQ to not exceed 2% of the total code. This weakness is chiefly classified as a quality issue rather than a direct security vulnerability, emphasizing its role in affecting maintainability and indicating that it might indirectly facilitate the introduction of more security-relevant weaknesses.

The relationships section in the description highlights its categorization under bad coding practices and its relevance to maintaining code quality as recognized by various CISQ measures. It's important to note that CWE-1085 is not to be used for mapping to real-world vulnerabilities directly due to its nature as a quality issue with no immediate security implications. Instead, focus should be on weaknesses that directly impact security in a more tangible manner. Despite its classification, the documentation stresses the importance of maintaining clean code practices to prevent the indirect introduction or masking of vulnerabilities and improve overall maintainability and security posture.

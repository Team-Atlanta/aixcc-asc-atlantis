CWE-368 addresses a specific kind of software vulnerability known as a Context Switching Race Condition. This weakness arises when a software product switches between different contexts (which cross privilege or other security boundaries) through a series of non-atomic actions, and a race condition occurs. This vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially modify or falsely represent the software's behavior during this context transition. This type of vulnerability is frequently observed in web browsers when switching between trusted and untrusted domains. During this transition, the browser might execute actions on one domain using the trust level and resources of another, leading to unauthorized actions or data access. The broader classification of this weakness falls under Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') and it has been identified as a source of numerous web-related vulnerabilities, demonstrated by multiple observed examples in CVE records. Essentially, the essence of CWE-368 encapsulates the dangerous possibility that non-atomic context switches, under race conditions, can be exploited by attackers to compromise the security boundaries intended by the application design.

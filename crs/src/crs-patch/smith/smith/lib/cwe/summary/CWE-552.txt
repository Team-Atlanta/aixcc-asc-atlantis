CWE-552 pertains to the issue where products make files or directories accessible to external parties without proper authorization, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized alterations. This vulnerability arises in contexts like web and FTP servers, where files stored under a root directory intended to be securely accessible end up being requested without adequate access control mechanisms in place. The weakness also extends to packaging systems that may inadvertently include sensitive files within archives like ZIP or tar files. In the realm of cloud technologies and containers, the problem manifests through misconfigured storage accounts that are readable or writable by public or anonymous users, thus compromising data integrity and confidentiality. This base-level weakness is related to broader categories of improper authorization and exposure of resources to the wrong sphere, highlighting an essential need for stringent access control and configuration practices to mitigate potential breaches in data security.

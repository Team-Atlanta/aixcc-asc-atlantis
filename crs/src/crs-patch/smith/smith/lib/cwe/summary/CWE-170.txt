CWE-170, identified as Improper Null Termination, references a weakness where a product fails to accurately terminate a string or array with a null character or an equivalent terminator. This vulnerability primarily manifests in two distinct situations: when an off-by-one error leads to writing a null character out of the intended bounds, triggering an overflow, or when a function like strncpy() is misused, preventing a null terminator from being appended altogether. These null termination errors are not limited to strings but can also involve arrays, and the ramifications of such issues span information disclosure, buffer overflow conditions potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, application crashes, and resource consumption due to excessive memory or CPU usage. The primary languages affected include C and C++, given their manual handling of memory and strings. Mitigation strategies involve the application of bounded string manipulation functions, thorough understanding and careful application of string functions, and the exploration of programming languages that inherently avoid these issues. Detection methods with high effectiveness include Automated Static Analysis tools, which analyze code to identify patterns potentially vulnerable to improper null termination without the necessity for code execution.

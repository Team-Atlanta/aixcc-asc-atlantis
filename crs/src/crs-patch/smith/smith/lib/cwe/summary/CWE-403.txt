CWE-403 addresses the security vulnerability known as "Exposure of File Descriptor to Unintended Control Sphere" or "File Descriptor Leak." This weakness pertains to a scenario where a process does not adequately close sensitive file descriptors before starting a child process, inadvertently allowing the child process to conduct unauthorized Input/Output (I/O) operations with those descriptors. This vulnerability emerges when the child process inherits open file descriptors from the parent process. It becomes particularly risky if the child process operates with lesser privileges than the parent but can access the file descriptor—and thereby the associated file—even though it shouldn't have the permissions to do so. Such a vulnerability could lead to unauthorized reading or modification of application data, underlining the importance of proper resource management and secure coding practices to prevent unintended information exposure or resource access. The term "leak" in this context can refer to either exposure or consumption of a resource, although here it specifically points to the exposure of file descriptors to processes that should not have access to them. Common consequences include confidentiality and integrity breaches, manifesting as unauthorized reading or altering of application data. This CWE is applicable across various languages and operating systems, particularly in Unix environments, and exemplifies a foundational issue in resource management errors.

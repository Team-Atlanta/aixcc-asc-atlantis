CWE-385 describes a covert timing channel vulnerability, where sensitive information is inferred from observing the time variations in system behavior. This vulnerability allows malicious users to gain privileged information not through direct access to the data but by analyzing how data transmission time varies under different conditions. For example, in cryptographic operations, the time taken to execute could vary depending on the internal state of the operation, inadvertently revealing sensitive information. Covert channels can be categorized broadly into storage or timing channels, with examples including variations in system paging rates, transaction execution times, and access times to shared resources. Mitigation strategies include designing and implementing systems in ways that do not introduce timing variances and adding artificial or random delays to operation times to mask such variations, thereby making the amount of CPU time consumed independent of the actions being taken by the application. The risks associated with covert timing channels are significant as they compromise confidentiality by potentially allowing unauthorized reading of application data through indirect means.

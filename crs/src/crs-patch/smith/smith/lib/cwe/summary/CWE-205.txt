CWE-205, titled "Observable Behavioral Discrepancy," identifies a category of vulnerability stemming from the differing behaviors observed in a product, which could inadvertently reveal internal state or decision-making processes, or highlight deviations from other products with similar functionalities. These discrepancies can provide unauthorized individuals with insights into the internal operations of a system, potentially simplifying or optimizing an attack. Such behavioral variances could even facilitate side-channel attacks. The essence of this weakness lies in the inadvertent exposure of information through behavior that deviates from the expected or normative, making it possible for attackers to glean sensitive information that should ideally remain concealed. The vulnerability underscores the importance of minimizing the amount of internal operation details a product reveals to prevent attackers from exploiting this information. This weakness, classified at a base level, is significant as it transcends specific technologies or resources, implying a broad applicability across different systems and platforms.

CWE-204, titled "Observable Response Discrepancy," identifies a vulnerability where a system's different responses to incoming requests can inadvertently or intentionally reveal sensitive internal state information to unauthorized external actors. This weakness falls under the Base level of abstraction, meaning it presents a problem that is largely independent of specific technologies but detailed enough to guide detection and prevention methods across several dimensions such as behavior, property, and technology. A common occurrence of this vulnerability is during authentication processes, where variation in failed-login messages might allow attackers to deduce whether a username exists in the system. For example, differentiating error messages for invalid usernames versus incorrect passwords can lead attackers closer to obtaining valid login credentials, thereby partially compromising system security. To mitigate this risk, systems should employ consistent, generic error messaging and ensure detailed error information is securely logged without being exposed to potential attackers. This practice helps maintain confidentiality and access control, preventing unauthorized access or data leakage through exploiting such response discrepancies.

CWE-580 concerns a specific weakness in software development related to the implementation of the `clone()` method without calling `super.clone()` to obtain the new object. This issue is categorized as a variant-level weakness, highly specific and linked to certain types of products, particularly those involving specific languages or technologies like Java. The essence of this weakness is that failing to adhere to the convention of using `super.clone()` in a `clone()` method's implementation can lead to subclasses returning objects of incorrect types, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially compromising integrity and quality of software. To mitigate this issue, developers are advised to ensure that `super.clone()` is called within their `clone()` methods to correctly obtain a new object instance. Alternatively, eliminating the `clone()` method and utilizing copy constructors may also be a viable solution. Detecting this weakness is highly feasible through automated static analysis which can scan source or compiled code to identify instances where `super.clone()` may not be appropriately called, ensuring high effectiveness in mitigating potential vulnerabilities associated with this issue.

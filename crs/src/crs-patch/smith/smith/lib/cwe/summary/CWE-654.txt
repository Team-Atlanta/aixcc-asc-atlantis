CWE-654 addresses a critical security vulnerability arising from the excessive reliance on a single factor for security decisions. It highlights the risk where a protection mechanism leans heavily, if not exclusively, on one condition or the integrity of a single object or entity to authorize access to restricted resources or functionalities. This approach significantly weakens security measures, as compromising the single factor (e.g., through theft or spoofing) can breach the entire security mechanism, granting unauthorized privileges or hiding malicious activities. By designating this as a base level weakness, CWE-654 underscores the necessity for more nuanced and multi-dimensional security practices, such as multi-factor authentication, to mitigate such vulnerabilities effectively. The weakness is not tied to any specific programming language or technology, indicating its widespread relevance across various software and hardware systems. Moreover, CWE-654's connections to principles like "Separation of Privilege" emphasize its foundational nature in secure design, urging the need for multiple checks and redundant access rules to ensure robust access control and prevent unauthorized privilege escalation or activity concealment.

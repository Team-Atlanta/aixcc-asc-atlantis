CWE-640 addresses the vulnerability arising from weak password recovery mechanisms for forgotten passwords. This base-level weakness is prevalent across various applications where users need to recover or change their passwords without knowing the original one. Such mechanisms are critical for user convenience but, if not designed and implemented securely, can undermine the robustness of an otherwise strong authentication system. The vulnerability could stem from easily guessable or discoverable security questions, implementation flaws that allow bypassing email verification, absence of throttling on password reset attempts leading to denial of service, or the insecure practice of sending the original password instead of generating a temporary one. These weaknesses can provide attackers unauthorized access to user accounts, degrade system availability, and exploit the system's security functions against it.

Mitigation strategies focus on thorough input validation, avoiding common and weak security questions, implementing throttling on incorrect attempts, ensuring secure and user-verified password resets, and generating temporary passwords for recovery processes. Awareness and adherence to these strategies during the architecture and design phases can significantly reduce the risks associated with password recovery mechanisms. Moreover, this CWE is also mapped to various categories highlighting its relevance to credentials management errors, business logic errors, and is also mentioned in several OWASP Top Ten Categories, indicating its widespread recognition and the necessity for effective remediation efforts in improving system security against password recovery exploitation.

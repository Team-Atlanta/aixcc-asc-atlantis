CWE-1021 focuses on the improper restriction of rendered UI layers or frames, a vulnerability that occurs when a web application fails to properly restrict frame objects or user interface (UI) layers, potentially belonging to another application or domain. This lack of restriction can lead to user confusion regarding the interface they are interacting with, making them susceptible to attacks such as clickjacking. Clickjacking, also known as UI redress attack or tapjacking in mobile applications, tricks users into interacting with an application without their intention to do so, possibly leading to undesired changes in privacy settings or other manipulations.

Mitigation strategies include implementing the X-Frame-Options header to restrict the use of web content within frames, implementing "frame-breaker" scripts to prevent a page from being framed by unauthorized domains, and utilizing Content Security Policy (CSP) directives like "frame-ancestors" or "frame-src" to control which sources can frame the content. Detection methods are highly effective through Automated Static Analysis, which analyzes code for potentially vulnerable patterns without execution. Knowledge of this vulnerability's potential consequences, such as gaining unauthorized privileges or accessing sensitive information, underscores the importance of adopting comprehensive security measures during the implementation phase to safeguard against such attacks.

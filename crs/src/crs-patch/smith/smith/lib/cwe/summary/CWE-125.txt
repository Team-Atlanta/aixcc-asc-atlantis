The CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read bug is a software vulnerability. It occurs when a product reads data beyond or before the intended buffer. This can potentially allow attackers to read sensitive information from other memory locations or cause a crash. This typically happens when the product reads varying amounts of data and assumes a sentinel, such as a NUL in a string, will stop the read operation. If the expected sentinel is not located in the out-of-bounds memory, the product may end up reading excessive data, leading to a segmentation fault or a buffer overflow. The consequences can include confidentiality breaches like reading memory and bypassing protection mechanisms. Solutions include implementing an "accept known good" input validation strategy and using a language that provides appropriate memory abstractions.

CWE-1079 is categorized under Common Weakness Enumeration and it identifies a situation where a parent class lacks a virtual destructor method. This configuration concerns object-oriented programming where a parent class is extended by one or more child classes. Without a virtual destructor in the parent class, deleting instances of derived classes through pointers to the base class can lead to incomplete destruction, thereby potentially leading to resource leaks or undefined behavior. This flaw is considered a base-level weakness because it details specific failure modes across several dimensions like behavior, property, and technology, with a focus on how it can impact reliability when the problematic code is accessible to an attacker. The consequences of such a weakness primarily affect the reliability of the software, potentially making the system more vulnerable or causing it to behave unpredictably. This particular type of weakness has been classified under "Insufficient Adherence to Expected Conventions" within the broader category of "Bad Coding Practices," linking it to issues of reliability and maintainability in software systems. CWE-1079 serves as a fundamental concern that could indirectly facilitate the introduction of further security-relevant weaknesses by undermining the integrity of object-oriented designs.

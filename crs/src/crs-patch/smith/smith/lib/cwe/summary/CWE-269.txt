The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) 269 describes the "Improper Privilege Management" bug, which occurs when software fails to properly assign, modify, track, or check the privileges of an actor. This creates an unintended sphere of control for the actor involved. Incorrectly managed privileges can lead to unauthorized gain of privileges or identity assumption. The bug can be caused during the implementation of an architectural security tactic and can occur regardless of specific programming language. Mitigation strategies include careful management of setting, managing, and handling of privileges, following the principles of least privilege, and separation of privilege. The weakness is observed to have a medium likelihood of being exploited.

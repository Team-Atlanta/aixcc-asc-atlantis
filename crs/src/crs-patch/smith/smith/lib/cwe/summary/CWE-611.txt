CWE-611 refers to a security weakness involving the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references. This base-level weakness arises when an application processes XML documents allowing XML entities with URIs to resolve to documents outside the intended control sphere. This vulnerability can lead to the embedding of incorrect documents into the application's output. XML documents can include a Document Type Definition (DTD), which supports defining XML entities by substituting strings in the form of URIs. These entities, when defined externally through a URI such as "file://" or "http://", permit attackers to cause the application to read local files or make outbound requests to external servers. This can bypass firewall restrictions or hide attack origins. The exploitation of this weakness can lead to arbitrary file access on the system, data confidentiality breaches, integrity compromise by manipulating outgoing HTTP requests, and potential Denial of Service (DoS) through resource consumption. Mitigation involves disabling external entity expansion in XML parsers and validators, and the effectiveness of detection methods like Automated Static Analysis is high for identifying such vulnerabilities.

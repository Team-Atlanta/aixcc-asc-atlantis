CWE-821, titled "Incorrect Synchronization," details a weakness that occurs when a product uses a shared resource concurrently without correctly synchronizing access to that resource. The core issue revolves around the lack of appropriate synchronization mechanisms, such as locks, mutexes, or semaphores, which could ensure that the shared resource remains in a consistent and expected state during its access by multiple concurrent threads or processes. Without proper synchronization, there can be unexpected or insecure behaviors in the system. Specifically, the outcome might include modification, unauthorized reading, or alteration of the application data and logic, especially if an attacker manages to influence the state of the shared resource. This weakness is categorized under "Base" in the Common Weakness Enumeration taxonomy, indicating that while it is somewhat independent of specific technologies or resources, it has enough detail to guide the detection and prevention of such issues. CWE-821 is linked to several related weaknesses and falls under broader categories that deal with concurrency issues and improper synchronization, underscoring the importance of correct concurrent access management in software and hardware systems for preserving data integrity, confidentiality, and overall system reliability.

CWE-1086 addresses a software design issue where a class is structured with an excessive number of child classes. This setup complicates the understanding and maintenance of the software, indirectly impacting security by making vulnerabilities harder to identify and rectify. It could also inadvertently facilitate the introduction of new vulnerabilities. Although the specific threshold for what constitutes an "excessive number" of child classes can vary depending on the context, the Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ) suggests a maximum of 10 child classes as a guideline. This weakness is considered a base level abstraction, indicating it has broad applicability across different technologies and resources, but still provides enough detail to guide the detection and prevention of the issue. It falls under the broader category of complexity issues and is tagged for its impact on reducing maintainability of software, categorizing it as an indirect weakness that could make security vulnerabilities more likely or harder to detect. Itâ€™s emphasized that this CWE ID should not be used for mapping real-world vulnerabilities directly since it's primarily a quality issue without immediate security implications.

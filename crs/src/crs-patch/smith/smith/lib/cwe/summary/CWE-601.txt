CWE-601 describes a security vulnerability known as URL Redirection to an Untrusted Site, also known as an Open Redirect. This type of vulnerability occurs when a web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site and uses that link to redirect the user. If an attacker is able to control this input, they can redirect users to malicious websites, thereby facilitating phishing attacks. Such attacks can be particularly deceptive if the malicious site has a URL that appears similar to a legitimate site, making the phishing attempt seem more credible. This vulnerability is present in applications that fail to adequately validate user-supplied URLs before performing the redirection.

Mitigations for this vulnerability include input validation strategies such as accepting only known good inputs, using a list of approved URLs for redirection, or utilizing an intermediate disclaimer page to warn users that they are leaving the current site. Implementing architecture and design strategies that ensure only trusted sites can be the destination of redirects and considering the use of nonces to validate redirect requests are also effective measures. Developers and architects should be aware of all potential sources of untrusted input and should not make assumptions about the immutability of inputs like hidden form fields and cookies. Automated and manual testing methods can be used to detect instances of this vulnerability, highlighting the importance of comprehensive security testing in the software development lifecycle.

CWE-392 identifies a critical software weakness that occurs when a system encounters an error but fails to appropriately communicate or report this error condition. This misstep is categorized as a "Missing Report of Error Condition," where the system doesn't provide a status code, return value, or any indication that an error has happened, leaving the system's users or processes in the dark about the fault. Such negligence can propel the system into an unforeseen state, potentially culminating in unexpected behavior or compromises in integrity. This issue is deeply entrenched in the software's error handling mechanisms and is a base level weakness, implying it is relatively independent of specific technologies yet detailed enough to guide detection and prevention efforts. This weakness is universally applicable, not confined to any single programming language, and its manifestations can vary significantly depending on the context, with potential consequences ranging from minor disruptions to significant security breaches. Demonstrative examples include situations where software continues operations or reports success even when critical operations fail internally, such as a servlet method that returns "200 OK" despite encountering exceptions, or cryptographic libraries defaulting to insecure functions when encountering errors, thus compromising the security of cryptographic keys. It highlights the essential practice of correctly and promptly reporting errors to prevent unintended states and behaviors that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

CWE-544 concerns the absence of a standardized approach to error handling across software code, potentially leading to inconsistent error management and subsequent vulnerabilities. Without a uniform methodology for handling errors, there's a risk of errors being handled on a case-by-case basis, which can lead to inconsistencies. This can cause the root causes of errors to be obscured and may inadvertently expose detailed error cause information to users, which should ideally be hidden. To mitigate this weakness, it's recommended to define an error-handling strategy that categorizes errors based on their severity, such as distinguishing between fatal errors and basic log events. Utilization of built-in language features or external packages that offer a straightforward API for detecting and managing errors, alongside established coding standards for error handling, can significantly reduce the risk associated with this weakness. This CWE entry is mapped to various standards and guidelines, indicating its relevance across many areas of software development and its recognition in the cybersecurity community.

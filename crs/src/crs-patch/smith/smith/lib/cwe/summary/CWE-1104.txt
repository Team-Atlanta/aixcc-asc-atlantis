CWE-1104 addresses the security risks associated with the use of unmaintained third-party components in software and hardware products. Such components lack active support or maintenance from their original developers or trusted proxies, which can lead to difficulties or impossibilities in resolving significant bugs, vulnerabilities, or other quality issues. This becomes a direct threat to the maintainability of the product, potentially making it more vulnerable to attacks or inadvertently allowing the introduction of new vulnerabilities. This base-level weakness is abstract yet specific enough to highlight concerns across behavior, property, technology, language, and resource dimensions. It is recognized as a pertinent issue by various related CWE entries and is linked to broader categories of software development and coding practices, including being a member of the OWASP Top Ten 2021 Category A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components. The reliance on these outdated components not only undermines the security and integrity of the product but also complicates the maintenance process, affecting the overall security posture indirectly by increasing the difficulty and time required to address vulnerabilities.

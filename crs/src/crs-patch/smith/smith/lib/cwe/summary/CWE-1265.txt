CWE-1265 addresses the issue of unintended reentrant invocation of non-reentrant code through nested calls, a situation potentially leading to security vulnerabilities in software and hardware systems. This weakness occurs when a product, while executing a block of non-reentrant code, makes a call that unintentionally results in a nested invocation of the same non-reentrant code. Such reentrant behavior can emerge in multifaceted products where a single function's execution might unknowingly initiate several other deeply nested function calls. This complexity increases notably in environments that process inputs from external or untrusted sources, like web browsers or PDF readers, thereby introducing a spectrum of possible control flows and state alterations that the original function caller does not expect. The vulnerability is further complicated by the fact that these unexpected code paths could modify program states or alter variables presumed stable by the initial call, ultimately leading to issues like memory corruption or unintended code execution. As an illustration, the CWE provides examples involving improper use of class methods in C++, where nested method invocations lead to the use of freed resources or inconsistent states due to reentrant calls, highlighting the critical need for reentrant-aware coding practices and design to mitigate such vulnerabilities effectively.

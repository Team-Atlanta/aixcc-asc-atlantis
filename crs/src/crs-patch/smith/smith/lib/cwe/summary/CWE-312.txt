CWE-312 concerns the cleartext storage of sensitive information, a security issue where products store sensitive data in an unencrypted form within a resource that may be accessible by unauthorized parties. This lack of encryption means attackers could potentially read the sensitive information, even if it's encoded in a non-human-readable form. Encrypting the data or adopting "double encryption" for additional layers of security, especially in cloud environments or systems where data might be more easily accessed over the Internet, can mitigate this risk. Various examples of this weakness include storing user credentials in plaintext within cookies, configuration files, or on disk, posing a significant risk of exposure in the event of system compromise. Specific instances of exploitation have led to the exposure of vast amounts of sensitive data, including personal, financial, and operational information. The CWE entry suggests implementing encryption for data storage and utilizing security features provided by cloud storage providers to protect data at rest. Automated static analysis tools can effectively detect instances of this weakness by analyzing code for patterns that store sensitive information without proper encryption.

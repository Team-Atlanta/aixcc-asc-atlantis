CWE-1230 describes a security weakness where sensitive information is protected from direct access but not adequately safeguarded when it comes to metadata derived from that sensitive information. Developers often secure the direct access to databases or other resources containing sensitive data, overlooking that the same information might be indirectly accessible through metadata, search indices, statistical reports, or similar data aggregators. If the access to these indirect sources isn't similarly restricted, attackers could potentially extract or infer sensitive information by exploiting these oversights. Examples provided include attackers using unique search terms associated with specific individuals or analyzing metadata like activity or creation dates to discern usage patterns, thereby breaching privacy or security protocols without directly accessing the restricted data. This weakness stems from a broader issue of improper authorization mechanisms that fail to comprehensively cover all data forms, including its metadata, thereby creating a potential exploit path for unauthorized access to sensitive information.

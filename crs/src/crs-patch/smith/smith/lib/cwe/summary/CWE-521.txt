**Summary of CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements**

CWE-521 refers to a vulnerability stemming from systems that do not enforce strong password requirements for user accounts. Essentially, it highlights the danger posed when authentication mechanisms rely on passwords that lack sufficient complexity, making them easily guessable by attackers. The crux of this weakness lies in the failure to enforce passwords that are complex enough to withstand brute-force attempts or other common attacking strategies aimed at password cracking. Appropriate password policies should enforce a mix of characteristics like minimum and maximum lengths, restrictions on password reuse, and prohibitions against easily guessable passwords, including common passwords or those containing user-specific information. 

The consequence of such a weakness is significant, often allowing attackers unauthorized access to user accounts, potentially leading to identity theft, data breaches, and other critical security compromises. To mitigate this issue, developers and architects are advised to design systems that require adherence to robust password policies and possibly incorporate additional authentication factors beyond just passwords. Detection methods might include automated static analysis with high effectiveness. Additionally, based on the severity and prevalence of this weakness, it falls under several CWE categories, including those related to broken authentication and session management, and is a common concern spotlighted in various security recommendations, including the OWASP Top Ten.

CWE-268, titled "Privilege Chaining," describes a security weakness where two distinct privileges, roles, capabilities, or rights are combined in a manner that enables an entity to perform actions that would be unauthorized without such a combination. It is categorized as a Base level weakness, indicating it offers enough specifics to guide the detection and prevention of the issue across various resources or technologies. This weakness often emerges during the implementation phase when architectural security measures are incorrectly applied, and it can manifest in any language or platform as it is not language-specific. A common consequence of this vulnerability is the unauthorized acquisition of additional privileges or identity assumption, potentially granting an attacker access to sensitive information or the ability to perform actions as another user. The likelihood of exploitation is considered high. Mitigation strategies include adhering to the principle of separation of privilege, careful management of privileges across different trust zones, and practicing environment hardening by running code with the minimum necessary privileges. Demonstrative examples, such as code snippets, further illustrate how improper checks on user roles can lead to unauthorized privilege escalation. This weakness is critical within the context of software security, emphasizing the need for meticulous design and implementation practices to prevent privilege abuse.

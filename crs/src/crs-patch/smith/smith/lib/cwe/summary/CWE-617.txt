CWE-617 involves the presence of an assert() or similar statements within a product that an attacker can exploit, leading to unintended application exits or severe behaviors. Assertions are often used to catch logic errors and prevent more serious vulnerability conditions from being reached. However, they can inadvertently cause a denial of service (DoS) if an attacker finds a way to trigger these assertions. Such scenarios typically occur when the code containing the assert statement responds to user input and, upon assertion failure, affects not just the attacker's session but the application's overall functionality or other usersâ€™ sessions. For example, if a server managing multiple connections experiences an assert() in one connection that causes all other connections to drop, it results in a reachable assertion and subsequently a denial of service. Mitigation strategies proposed include enhanced input validation to prevent untrusted data from influencing control flow in a way that reaches these assert statements, thereby minimizing the risks associated with a reachable assertion.

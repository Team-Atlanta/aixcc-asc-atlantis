CWE-620 deals with a critical security weakness where software systems allow the change of a user's password without requiring the current password or another form of authentication. This flaw can let attackers easily change the passwords of other users, thereby hijacking their accounts and gaining access to their privileges and data. The essence of this vulnerability lies in the lack of a proper authentication mechanism before permitting password changes, which is a common feature expected in secure software systems to prevent unauthorized access. This weakness is broadly relevant across software design and implementation phases and does not pertain to any specific programming language, indicating its widespread implication. Mitigations include enforcing the input of the original password upon attempting a password change and applying secure "forgotten password" procedures that ensure information is provided only to the genuine user. Proper attention during the architecture and design phases to enhance authentication measures can significantly reduce the risk of this weakness being exploited.

CWE-88 addresses the security weakness involving improper neutralization of argument delimiters in commands, commonly known as 'Argument Injection'. This base-level weakness occurs when a program composes a command to be executed by another component but fails to properly delineate its intended arguments, options, or switches, potentially leaving it vulnerable to manipulation. Developers might assume that a command string constructed using interpolation will only process the specified arguments or options. However, if an attacker can introduce input that includes argument-separating delimiters into this untrusted input, the actual executed command may carry more arguments than intended. This could alter the command's behavior to the attacker's advantage, depending on what the extraneous arguments allow, potentially leading to security-relevant consequences such as unauthorized command execution, alteration of execution logic, or sensitive data access or modification.

Mitigation strategies involve rigorous input validation, employing parameterization techniques, and adopting safer alternatives to constructing command strings with direct user input. For example, using functions that support the specification of independent arguments can help automatically ensure appropriate quoting or escaping, thereby reducing the risk of argument injection vulnerabilities. Implementing these strategies during the implementation phase, as well as through proper architectural and design considerations, can significantly mitigate the risk posed by CWE-88.

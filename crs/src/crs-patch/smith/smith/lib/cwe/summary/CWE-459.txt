CWE-459, titled "Incomplete Cleanup," refers to a vulnerability where a product fails to adequately remove temporary or supporting resources after their use. This weakness is categorized as a "Base" level issue within the Common Weakness Enumeration framework, meaning it is relatively independent of specific technologies but detailed enough to outline specific detection and prevention methods. Incomplete cleanup issues may arise across various platforms and languages, presenting a non-language-specific threat with indeterminate prevalence. The primary risk associated with this weakness is the unauthorized access or manipulation of application data, possibly leading to a denial of service through resource consumption if temporary files overflow due to directories having limits on the number of files. This vulnerability could be exploited in several ways, such as leaving sensitive information in resources that are not properly removed before reuse, or through improper cleanup operations upon an exception being thrown. Common examples include failing to delete temporary files after use, leading to potential info leaks. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended that temporary files and other resources be promptly deleted or released as soon as they are no longer needed. Detection of this vulnerability can be highly effective through automated static analysis, which scans the source or compiled code without execution to identify potential insecure patterns connecting data sources to sinks.

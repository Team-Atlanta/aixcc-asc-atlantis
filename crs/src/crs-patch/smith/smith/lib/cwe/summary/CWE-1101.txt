CWE-1101 describes an issue where products utilize auto-generated code reliant on a specific runtime component for execution. This reliance complicates maintenance efforts and could indirectly affect security by making it challenging to identify or rectify vulnerabilities, potentially facilitating the introduction of further vulnerabilities. Although categorized as a base-level weakness, which is somewhat independent of specific resources or technologies and outlined with adequate detail for detection and prevention, CWE-1101 is fundamentally a quality concern rather than a direct security threat. It is suggested not to use CWE-1101 for mapping real-world vulnerabilities due to its primary focus on quality issues without direct security implications. This weakness is listed under the category of "Bad Coding Practices" and noted for its potential to decrease maintainability, serving as an indirect risk factor that might ease the introduction of security-relevant weaknesses or obscure their detection.

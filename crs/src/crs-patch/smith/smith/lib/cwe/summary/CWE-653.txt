CWE-653, titled "Improper Isolation or Compartmentalization," identifies a weakness in the way a product fails to adequately separate or isolate functions, processes, or resources that necessitate different levels of privilege, rights, or permissions. This lapse can lead to severe security vulnerabilities, particularly when lower-privileged users access components that, lacking stringent compartmentalization, might allow attackers to extend the scope and scale of the damage to areas requiring higher privileges. Traditionally encapsulated under various notions of privilege separation, such as "Separation of Privilege," the CWE-653 addresses the broader concept of ensuring distinct and secure operational boundaries between different system components to prevent escalation of privileges or breach of protected mechanisms. This weakness, if exploited, can allow attackers to bypass access control measures, assuming identities or gaining unauthorized privileges, thus underlining the critical need for a well-architected compartmentalization within systems to strengthen security postures against such vulnerabilities. Methods for mitigating this weakness include reinforcing privilege differentiation among modules, entities, or objects within a system and employing rigorous access control measures to manage and restrict interactions across these segregated components.

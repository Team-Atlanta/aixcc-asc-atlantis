CWE-395 pertains to the misuse of catching `NullPointerExceptions` as a flawed method of null pointer dereference prevention. This base-level weakness often indicates that the programmer opted to catch the resulting exception instead of addressing the fundamental issue causing the null pointer dereference. It highlights three primary circumstances under which `NullPointerExceptions` are caught: as a shortcut to correct an actual null pointer dereference, to explicitly throw a `NullPointerException` signaling an error, or as part of test harnesses designed to feed unexpected inputs to classes being tested, with only the latter scenario deemed acceptable. This practice is discouraged as it can lead to improper exception handling and control flow issues, primarily when used as a substitute for proper input validation or error handling, potentially leading to resource consumption or DoS if exploited. The recommended approach involves avoiding excessive reliance on exception catching for error handling, particularly for user input validation, to preclude performance degradation. Detection methods include automated and manual static analysis, dynamic analysis, and comprehensive architectural or design review to identify and mitigate instances of this weakness, which primarily affects Java but can be relevant to other programming environments where similar patterns are permitted.

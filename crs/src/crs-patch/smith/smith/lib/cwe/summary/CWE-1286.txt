CWE-1286 pertains to the improper validation of the syntactic correctness of input, classified as a base-level weakness within the Common Weakness Enumeration framework. This issue arises when a system receives input presumed to be in a specific format or structure but fails to adequately verify or incorrectly validates that the input adheres to the expected syntax. Inputs of this nature could range from data exchange formats and markup languages to programming languages. The absence of proper validation can lead to parsing failures, the triggering of unintended errors, or even the exposure of underlying vulnerabilities that would remain non-exploitable had the input been properly syntactically validated. Consequences vary depending on context but often involve technical impact that can be leveraged in various ways by attackers. Mitigation strategies emphasize the importance of robust input validation, endorsing an "accept known good" approachâ€”meaning only allowing inputs that strictly comply with predefined specifications and outright rejecting or sanitizing any that do not. This strategy is highlighted for its high effectiveness in preventing the exploitation of such weaknesses.

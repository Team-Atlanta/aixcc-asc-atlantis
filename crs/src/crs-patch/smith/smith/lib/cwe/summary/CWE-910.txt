CWE-910 concerns the issue where a product continues to use or access a file descriptor after it has already been closed. This vulnerability stems from a failure to properly manage file descriptors, which, upon being closed and potentially reassigned, can lead to unintended actions such as writing to or reading from an incorrect file or device. This scenario primarily occurs because closed file descriptors can be reallocated to other files or devices, causing the original code to interact with different resources than intended. This vulnerability, categorized under CWE as a Base level weakness, highlights the importance of proper resource management in software and hardware systems to prevent security breaches and data integrity issues. It is pertinent in various programming contexts, with C and C++ languages noted for sometimes being prevalent to this type of weakness, though it is not language-specific. The consequences of exploiting this vulnerability range from confidentiality breaches, such as unauthorized reading of files, to availability impacts, including potential crashes of the application due to improper file descriptor access. The likelihood of exploit is considered medium, emphasizing the need for developers and security researchers to carefully manage and monitor the use of file descriptors within their systems.

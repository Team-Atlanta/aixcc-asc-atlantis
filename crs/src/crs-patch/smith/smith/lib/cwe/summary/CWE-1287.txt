CWE-1287 relates to Improper Validation of Specified Type of Input, a vulnerability where a product does not appropriately validate or incorrectly validates that the received input matches the expected type. This vulnerability can manifest in both software and hardware, potentially leading to attackers exploiting the system by triggering unexpected errors, executing incorrect actions, or taking advantage of latent vulnerabilities that are not exploitable when inputs conform to expected types. This issue is typically more prevalent in type-unsafe programming languages or in environments that support casting between different types. The vulnerability is outlined within the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), a community-developed list aimed at identifying and categorizing common weaknesses and vulnerabilities in software and hardware.

Mitigation strategies primarily focus on rigorous input validation. Adopting an "accept known good" approach, where only inputs that strictly adhere to predefined specifications are accepted, can significantly reduce the risk. This entails validating all input properties, including its type, length, range of acceptable values, and adherence to business logic rules. Relying solely on denylists to filter out known bad inputs is discouraged since it may not cover all potentially harmful inputs. Ensuring input validation can deal with all possible inputs effectively is pivotal for securing systems against this type of vulnerability. The CWE-1287 entry, still evolving, emphasizes the critical nature of understanding and addressing input validation weaknesses in preventing security vulnerabilities.

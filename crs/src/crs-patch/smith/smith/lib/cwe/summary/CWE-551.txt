CWE-551 addresses the security weakness where incorrect behavior order, specifically authorization procedures, occur before proper URL parsing and canonicalization within web applications. This base level vulnerability arises because if a web server does not adequately analyze requested URLs to resolve references to directories (using notations like "/./" which means current directory) before performing authorization checks, attackers could bypass security mechanisms. For example, if "/SomeDirectory" is protected but the server fails to normalize "/./SomeDirectory" to "/SomeDirectory" before the authorization, attackers might exploit this oversight to access restricted resources. To mitigate this vulnerability, the design phase should ensure that URL inputs are decoded and canonicalized into a consistent internal format prior to authorization checks. This includes avoiding double-decoding inputs, which can undermine allowlist schemes by inserting hazardous inputs post-validation. The CWE-551 vulnerability is crucial because it concerns the foundational security measure of access control, where exploitation could enable unauthorized access by circumventing protection mechanisms designed to restrict access to authenticated and authorized users.

CWE-1333 concerns the vulnerability associated with using regular expressions that possess inefficient, potentially exponential worst-case computational complexities, leading to the excessive consumption of CPU cycles. This vulnerability arises primarily due to the feature of "backtracking" in some regular expression engines, wherein the engine attempts to match different combinations if the initial token does not match, potentially leading to an extensive number of backtracking attempts that are exponential relative to the input length. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting inputs that fail to match the regular expression, especially if the input is sufficiently long, causing the application to consume an excessive amount of CPU resources and possibly leading to a denial of service (DoS). This vulnerability is known by alternate terms such as Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) and catastrophic backtracking, reflecting its potential to cause significant impact on the availability of resources. Mitigation strategies include limiting backtracking in regular expressions, setting backtracking limits in the regex implementation configuration, avoiding untrusted input for regex operations, and limiting the input length for regex processing to prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability.

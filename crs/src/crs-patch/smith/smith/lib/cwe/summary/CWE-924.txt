CWE-924 focuses on the improper enforcement of message integrity during the transmission of data in a communication channel. This flaw occurs when a product, which has established a communication channel with an endpoint and receives a message from that endpoint, fails to adequately verify if the message has been altered during its transmission. This vulnerability allows attackers the potential to modify the transmitted message or to spoof the endpoint by either interfering with the data as it crosses the network or by redirecting the connection to a system under their control. This can lead to various adverse outcomes, including but not limited to, attackers gaining unwanted privileges or assuming the identity meant for the original endpoint. Such actions can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the communication, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control. CWE-924 is a base-level abstraction issue, providing specific methods for detection and prevention of this weakness, making it crucial for ensuring the security of communication channels against tampering or spoofing attempts.

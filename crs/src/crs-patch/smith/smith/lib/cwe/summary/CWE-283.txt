CWE-283: Unverified Ownership is a security weakness where a product fails to accurately ascertain that a critical resource is under the control of the correct entity. This weakness, attributed the ID 283 and considered a base level abstraction, emphasizes flaws in resource or technology that although mostly independent, are detailed enough for specific detection and prevention methods. It is highlighted that such a weakness usually pivots around two or three dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. The consequence of this failure can lead to unauthorized entities gaining privileges or assuming identity by gaining access to system resources they should not have. For instance, an example provided involves a privileged program receiving user inputs potentially of lower privilege without verifying the ownership of the process to be acted upon, like killing a process, which could allow an attacker to terminate arbitrary processes. Mitigation strategies emphasize the stringent management of privileges, enforcing a principle of separation of privilege where multiple conditions must be met for access to be granted. This weakness is part of broader categories and is important in understanding access control issues; it is mentioned within contexts such as business logic errors, authorizing actors, and is a recognized part of the OWASP Top Ten 2004 Category A2 - Broken Access Control. Effective recognition and prevention of unverified ownership vulnerabilities require careful attention to design and architecture, ensuring that security measures are incorporated from the early phases of development.

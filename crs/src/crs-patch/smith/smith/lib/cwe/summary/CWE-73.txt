CWE-73 addresses the vulnerability that arises when user-supplied input is allowed to control or influence file paths or names used in filesystem operations. This vulnerability can enable attackers to access, modify, or delete system files or other critical files that are essential for the application's functionality, leading to potential security breaches. The weakness occurs under two conditions: firstly, when an attacker can specify a path used in a filesystem operation, and secondly, when by specifying the resource, the attacker gains capabilities not intended to be permissible. Consequences of this vulnerability range from unauthorized reading or modification of files and directories, potentially leading to confidential information disclosure, integrity compromise, and even execution of unauthorized code or commands. Countermeasures include stringent input validation, use of allowlists for filename and path inputs, and employing security measures such as running code within a sandbox environment to limit the potential impact. The detection and mitigation of such path and file manipulation vulnerabilities are crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of an application's filesystem operations.

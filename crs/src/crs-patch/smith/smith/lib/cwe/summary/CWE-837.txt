CWE-837 addresses the issue of improperly enforcing unique action requirements in software and hardware systems. It refers to situations where a product should restrict a user or actor to perform a certain action only once or maintain the uniqueness of an action, yet fails to enforce this constraint effectively. This weakness can lead to various security-related complications, notably in systems where such actions have significant outcomes, like voting systems, financial transactions, or any other operation where duplication or repetition could lead to unfair advantages, fraud, or other unintended consequences. For instance, in a voting application, the lack of proper enforcement could allow an attacker to cast multiple votes, thereby skewing the results and undermining the integrity of the process. This class of weakness, categorized under CWE-837, primarily concerns itself with the incorrect control or limitation of action frequency and is linked to broader classes and categories of weaknesses, including Behavioral Problems and Business Logic Errors. Consequences of exploiting this weakness vary by context, but often involve gaining an unfair advantage or affecting the correctness and intended outcome of the product. Examples of observed instances include multiple instances of voting, ticket booking, and content rating systems allowing actions to be performed repeatedly, thwarting the system's fairness or availability.

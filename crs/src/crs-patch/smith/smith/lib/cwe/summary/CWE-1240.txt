CWE-1240 is a security vulnerability related to the use of cryptographic primitives with a risky implementation, either due to the use of non-standard, unproven, or non-compliant cryptographic approaches. Cryptographic primitives are basic building blocks of cryptographic protocols and systems, such as digital signatures, hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography. These primitives are mathematically defined to perform very specific tasks in a reliable fashion. The security of a cryptographic system heavily relies on these primitives; hence, if a primitive is weakened or broken - for example, by finding a way to break it with fewer attempts than expected - the entire system could be compromised. This weakness highlights the importance of using strong, proven cryptographic primitives, especially in hardware implementations that are difficult to update post-deployment. Weak or compromised cryptographic implementations can lead to sensitive information exposure and other security breaches.

The vulnerability can be introduced at various phases of development, especially during architecture and design when choices are made regarding which cryptographic primitives to use. Even if a secure design is specified, changes during implementation due to constraints can result in vulnerabilities. The consequences of such weaknesses primarily affect confidentiality, potentially allowing unauthorized access to read application data. Several observed examples include the use of insecure hashing algorithms like MD5 instead of more secure options, enabling outdated ciphers, and improper nonce generation in cryptographic protocols. Mitigation strategies involve adhering to the latest security standards for cryptographic modules (such as FIPS 140-3 certification), avoiding custom or proprietary cryptographic algorithms, ensuring cryptographic agility for future updates, and employing vetted cryptographic libraries to avoid implementation errors.

CWE-209 details a security weakness where a product generates error messages containing sensitive information about its environment, users, or data. This exposure can occur through directly crafted error messages by developers (self-generated) or by messages produced by external elements like language interpreters (externally-generated), without direct control from the developer. The sensitive information revealed can range from direct sensitive data like passwords to information aiding the execution of further attacks, such as system paths or SQL query details. The disclosure can lead to targeted attacks, including path traversal or SQL injection, leveraging the detailed insight provided by the error messages. Mitigation strategies involve limiting error message details to prevent revealing excessive information, ensuring logging of detailed errors does not expose sensitive data, and employing safe error handling practices to avoid leakage. Various coding practices and configurations can also reduce risk, such as minimizing verbose error messages in production environments or using error handling that prevents detailed information disclosure to unauthorized users.

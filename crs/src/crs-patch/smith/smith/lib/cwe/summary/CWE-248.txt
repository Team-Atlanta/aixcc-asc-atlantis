CWE-248, denoted as Uncaught Exception, identifies a software vulnerability where an exception is thrown by a function but not effectively caught. This base-level weakness, mostly independent of a specific resource or technology, arises when software fails to handle anomalous conditions properly, potentially causing it to crash or expose sensitive data. This failure in exception handling is a prevalent issue that spans various programming languages like C++, Java, and C#, affecting availability and confidentiality through possible DoS attacks or unintended data exposure. Automated static analysis tools show high effectiveness in identifying instances of this weakness by analyzing source code patterns that could lead to vulnerability. The weakness is observed in diverse real-world scenarios, including failing DNS lookups, inappropriate memory allocation, and exception scenarios in critical sections that might lead to crashes or operational disruptions. CWE-248 links to broader categories focused on error conditions, control flow management, and emphasizes the importance of correctly implementing and handling exceptions to prevent potential security risks.

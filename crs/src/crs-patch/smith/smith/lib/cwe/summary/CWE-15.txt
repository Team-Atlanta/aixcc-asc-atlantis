CWE-15, titled "External Control of System or Configuration Setting," details a vulnerability wherein one or more system settings or configuration elements can be externally controlled by an unauthorized user. This flaw exists at the base level of abstraction, indicative of a weakness that, while somewhat independent of specific resources or technologies, contains enough detail to guide detection and prevention methods across various dimensions such as behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.

It is highlighted that allowing external control over system settings can lead to service disruptions or cause applications to behave in unexpected and potentially malicious ways. The description offers examples, including problematic C and Java code snippets where user input directly controls critical system configurations like host ID and database catalog settings, respectively. Such vulnerabilities expose systems to numerous risks; attackers might manipulate these settings to misidentify a machine on a network or gain unauthorized access to sensitive portions of a database.

Mitigation strategies emphasize the importance of system design considerations, such as compartmentalization, privilege separation, and adherence to the principle of least privilege. Recommendations for both the architecture and design phases, as well as implementation, suggest limiting the control untrusted data have over sensitive values. Automated static analysis is presented as an effective detection method, indicating high utility in identifying instances of this weakness without needing to execute code. This CWE entry is also mapped to various taxonomy names and attack patterns, demonstrating its relevance across different security discussions and frameworks.

CWE-639, titled "Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key," highlights a critical issue where a system's authorization checks fail to prevent users from accessing other users' data by manipulating the key values that identify the data. This vulnerability arises from the system retrieving user records based on key values that users can control, without adequately verifying if the authenticated user has the necessary entitlements to access the requested information. Attackers, typically required to be authenticated users, can exploit this weakness by manipulating key values, such as URL parameters or hidden form fields, to bypass authorization checks and gain unauthorized access to other users' data. This could lead to horizontal authorization violations, where users access data at the same privilege level but belonging to different users, or even vertical privilege escalations if the manipulated key indicates administrative status. Common mitigations include ensuring appropriate privilege checks for data access, using encryption or digital signatures to protect keys, and employing secure coding practices to prevent user manipulation of key values. This vulnerability underscores the importance of robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to safeguard against unauthorized data access.

CWE-829 involves the inclusion of functionality (like a library or web widget) from an external source that is not within the intended control sphere of the product, posing a security risk to the system. This can lead to the importation, requirement, or invocation of executable functionality from an untrustworthy source without adequate protection mechanisms. Such external functionality may be inherently malicious, could have been tampered with en route from a trusted source, or might contain vulnerabilities. It opens up various attack vectors, including but not limited to the injection of malware, exposure of sensitive information through excessive privileges or permissions, DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, cookie theft, and open redirects to malicious sites.

The root cause of this vulnerability is often found during the implementation phase, where insufficient security measures are in place to authenticate, validate, or sanitize external code before its integration into the system. The consequences can be severe, affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability, where attackers could execute unauthorized code or commands, compromise the application, or cause system downtimes. Effective mitigation strategies involve architectural and design changes, such as the use of vetted libraries or frameworks, stringent input validation, and environmental hardening to minimize the attack surface. Additionally, ensuring consistent security checks both on the client and server sides, reducing code execution privileges, and sandboxing or jailing execution environments can significantly mitigate potential risks associated with the inclusion of untrusted functionality.

CWE-1052 pertains to the excessive use of hard-coded literals for initializations in software products, beyond simple integers or static constant elements. This practice can complicate the modification and maintenance of the product, indirectly impacting security by increasing the difficulty and time required to rectify vulnerabilities. Such a method might also inadvertently facilitate the introduction of new vulnerabilities. This weakness is identified at the Base abstraction level, indicating that while it is somewhat independent of specific resources or technologies, it provides enough detail to assist in detection and prevention methods. The issue is categorized under CWE-1419 for incorrect initialization of resources, with further associations to categories related to initialization and cleanup errors, and it underscores broader concerns about maintainability cited by CISQ Quality Measures. The excessive use of hard-coded literals is acknowledged as an acceptable-use case for mapping to real-world vulnerabilities due to its base-level abstraction, which aligns well with identifying root causes of vulnerabilities.

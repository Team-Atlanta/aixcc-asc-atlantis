CWE-319 describes the security weakness where sensitive or security-critical information is transmitted in cleartext over a communication channel that could be monitored or "sniffed" by unauthorized parties. This vulnerability is significant because many communication channels—such as the internet, internal networks, the cloud, and even hardware-specific technologies like internal hardware networks and external debug channels—can be intercepted by adversaries. These adversaries may not have the right to access the data but could exploit the cleartext transmission to obtain sensitive information. The weakness is applicable across various platforms, including cloud computing, mobile, ICS/OT, and system on chip technologies.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the data should be encrypted before being transmitted using reliable cryptographic protocols, ensuring that only authorized parties can decipher the transmitted information. For web applications, SSL (Secure Socket Layer) should be used throughout the entire session, from login to logout. In hardware design, secure communication paths for critical data should be established using approved encryption algorithms. Monitoring tools and techniques, including automated static analysis and manual analyses like penetration testing, can help detect instances of cleartext transmission of sensitive information and assess the security of communication channels.

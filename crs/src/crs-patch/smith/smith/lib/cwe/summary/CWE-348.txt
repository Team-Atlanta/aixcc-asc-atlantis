CWE-348 involves situations where a software product has access to two different sources for the same data or information but chooses to use the source that is less reliable in terms of verification capabilities, trustworthiness, or resilience against attacks. This can lead to significant security vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to exploit the trust placed in the less secure data source to bypass protection mechanisms, gain unauthorized access, or assume the identity of another user. Examples include using user-controllable HTTP headers as a source of truth over more secure server variables. The weakness is a base-level issue that can manifest in any programming language and affects various aspects of access control and data integrity. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can bypass protection mechanisms designed to restrict access to sensitive information or functionalities within a system. This can lead to unauthorized access and potentially gain elevated privileges. Demonstrative instances showcase real-world exploits, like spoofing IP addresses through manipulable HTTP headers, to bypass security filters or hide malicious activities. Proper handling involves favoring more secure and verifiable data sources over those that can be easily manipulated by an attacker.

CWE-779 details a scenario where excessive logging of information in software can inadvertently compromise system security and performance. This occurs when a product generates too much log data, which not only makes the log files cumbersome to process but also could obstruct recovery efforts or forensic investigations post an attack. While logging serves as a beneficial practice, particularly for debugging during development phases, an overload of log data in a production environment may mask abnormal activities, thereby offering attackers concealment and complicating the audit trail for forensic scrutiny. Such a situation could lead to log files consuming excessive resources, like disk space and CPU time, hampering system performance and potentially hiding malicious activities from being detected. This can result in a variety of technical impacts including denial of service due to resource consumption and the undermining of non-repudiation efforts by making logs less useful to analysts. Effective mitigations involve the suppression of duplicate log entries, implementing log size controls, and adjusting logging configurations as systems transition from development to production environments. This weakness is broadly applicable, not specific to any language, and presents a low likelihood of exploitation with potentially severe consequences for availability and non-repudiation.

CWE-1322 concerns the use of blocking code within a single-threaded, non-blocking context. This weakness arises when a program designed to be non-blocking, for purposes such as scalability, incorporates code that can block during execution. Blocking code can lead to a denial of service by causing the program to hang or freeze. This can happen either through direct invocation by an attacker or via environmental conditions that an attacker can influence. Examples include intensive computations or the use of blocking library calls, like those performing exclusive file operations or depending on successful network communications. This is particularly relevant in environments using single-threaded models to mitigate the resource burdens of multi-threading, evident in platforms like Python asyncio, Vert.x, and Node.js. Blocking code in such contexts halts the event loop, causing potential safety or functional issues.

To mitigate this weakness, it's advised to replace blocking calls with non-blocking, asynchronous alternatives where possible. Additionally, for intensive computations, breaking down the tasks into smaller, manageable units that can be processed without blocking the main event loop is recommended. Ensuring adherence to these practices requires careful consideration of the specific framework and application design being employed. This CWE entry, being at a Base level of abstraction, is crucial for understanding and mapping the root causes of relevant vulnerabilities in software development and implementation phases.

CWE-1103 focuses on the use of platform-dependent third-party components in software, highlighting a base-level weakness where a product relies on third-party components not offering equivalent functionality across desired platforms. This dependency complicates maintenance, indirectly impacting security by making it more challenging and time-consuming to identify and rectify vulnerabilities, potentially facilitating the introduction of new vulnerabilities. This weakness is categorized under "Bad Coding Practices" and is seen as indirectly enabling the introduction of security-relevant weaknesses or their detection challenges. Although listed under CWE, it's specified for non-use in mapping to real-world vulnerabilities due to its nature as a quality issue rather than a direct security implication. The documentation emphasizes the necessity for developers and security professionals to seek out weaknesses with more immediate security consequences rather than this quality-based concern.

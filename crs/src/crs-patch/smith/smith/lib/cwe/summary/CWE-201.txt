CWE-201 deals with the insertion of sensitive information into data that is transmitted to another entity or actor, where such information should not be accessible to that entity. This security weakness encompasses scenarios where data inherently sensitive (like credentials, private messages) or data that could be utilized for further exploitation of the system (like internal file system structures) is included in transmitted data. It's a base-type vulnerability, implying it has enough context to be mostly technology or resource independent but detailed enough to guide specific detection and prevention methods. This weakness is related to and can lead to various other vulnerabilities and is categorized under several broader and more specific weaknesses, like exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor, use of GET request methods with sensitive query strings, and more.

Mitigation strategies involve defining what constitutes sensitive data and who should access it from the design phase, ensuring that only necessary information is transmitted, and establishing secure default error messages to prevent accidental data exposure. Automated Static Analysis (Static Application Security Testing or SAST) is highlighted as a highly effective detection method for this class of vulnerability. Proper compartmentalization and adherence to the principle of least privilege in system design are emphasized to prevent unauthorized data exposure. Lastly, CWE-201 offers guidance on various phases of software development, from requirements to system configuration, to mitigate such vulnerabilities effectively.

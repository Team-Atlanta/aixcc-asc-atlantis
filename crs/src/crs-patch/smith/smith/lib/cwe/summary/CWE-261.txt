The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE-261) identifies "Weak Encoding for Password" as a significant security issue that stems from insufficient protection mechanisms for passwords. This weakness typically arises when passwords are stored in plaintext within an application's properties or configuration files. Attempts to obscure these passwords using simple encoding functions, such as Base64, do not offer adequate protection and are considered a flawed approach to password management. This issue is classified as a Base level weakness, indicating it provides enough detail to outline specific detection and prevention methods across various dimensions, including behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. The weakness is related to broader security concerns involving insufficiently protected credentials and cryptographic issues, highlighting the need for stronger encryption methods. Practical examples include scenarios where passwords encoded in Base64 can be easily decoded by unauthorized individuals with access to configuration files or registry keys, leading to potential system breaches. Effective mitigations for this problem involve encrypting passwords using keys that are at least 128 bits in length. Detection methods such as Automated Static Analysis are highly effective at identifying instances of this weakness by analyzing source or compiled code without execution. This CWE is part of various categories and views that correspond to common security errors and failures, underscoring its relevance in understanding and addressing fundamental cryptography failures in software development.

CWE-649 identifies a vulnerability rooted in the reliance on encryption or obfuscation methods for security-relevant inputs without conducting proper integrity checks to detect unauthorized modifications. This weakness emerges when applications use weak or incorrectly implemented encryption to protect client-controllable tokens or parameters, which can affect user or system state. Without integrity verification, these tokens or parameters could be tampered with by attackers, seeking to elevate privileges, disclose sensitive information, or alter system behavior to their advantage. The core issue lies in the misuse of confidentiality measures, such as obfuscation or encryption, as a means of ensuring data integrity, which they are not suited for.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it's crucial to enforce integrity protection measures for critical client-controllable tokens or parameters. This can involve using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) methods like digital signatures or employing other mechanisms to verify data integrity on the server side. Practices such as locking out users after repeated requests with invalid token values, ensuring token or parameter values aren't easily guessed, and correctly implementing encryption standards are recommended. The emphasis is on not relying solely on obfuscation and ensuring encryption is applied correctly, acknowledging that even well-encrypted data can be compromised if integrity is not adequately safeguarded.

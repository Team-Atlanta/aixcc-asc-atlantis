CWE-130, also known as "Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency," addresses a common software weakness wherein an application fails to properly handle or incorrectly manages a length field that is inconsistent with the actual length of the associated data. This kind of weakness can lead to a range of security vulnerabilities, primarily because it can be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the length parameter associated with an input. By doing so, adversaries can potentially cause the application to behave in unexpected and often malicious ways, such as triggering buffer overflows or executing arbitrary code. The root of this issue lies in the discrepancy between the expected length of data (as indicated by a length field) and the actual data length, which if manipulated, can lead to the misuse of application logic or memory. This problem is not specific to any programming language or platform and can occur in various contexts where data length is a critical parameter, highlighting the importance of validating and relying on consistent length information within software components.

The risk associated with CWE-130 spans various consequences, from data confidentiality and integrity breaches to potential denial of service. Examples cited include historical vulnerabilities enabling attackers to achieve impacts such as memory modification, execution of unauthorized code, or system crashes. To mitigate such vulnerabilities, it's essential to rigorously validate the size of user-supplied data, avoid letting users control buffer sizes, and reconcile any differences between specified and actual data sizes during the implementation phase. This CWE is mapped to several observed real-world vulnerabilities, signifying its applicability across different software domains and emphasizing the critical need for secure handling of length parameters to prevent exploitable inconsistencies.

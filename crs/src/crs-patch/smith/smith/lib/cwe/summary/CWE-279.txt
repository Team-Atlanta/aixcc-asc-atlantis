CWE-279 describes a security weakness where a product incorrectly assigns permissions to an object during its execution, violating the intended permissions specified by the user. This issue belongs to the Variant level of abstraction, indicating it's specific to certain types of products, technologies, or languages, and involves detailed dimensions such as behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. The primary consequence of this weakness is unauthorized access or modification of data, compromising confidentiality and integrity by allowing attackers to read or modify application data beyond the intended permissions. Mitigation strategies involve careful management of privileges and trust zones throughout the software's architecture and design phases, emphasizing the principle of least privilege and compartmentalization to ensure that sensitive data remains within secure trust boundaries. This weakness is not language-specific and has been associated with various real-world vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of secure permission settings and management to safeguard against unauthorized access and data breaches.

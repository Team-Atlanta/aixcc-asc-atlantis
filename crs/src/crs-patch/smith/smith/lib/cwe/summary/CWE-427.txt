CWE-427 concerns a vulnerability arising from using a fixed or controlled search path that includes directories or locations that can be manipulated by unintended actors, often leading to the possibility of executing unauthorized code. This issue typically manifests when software uses directory search paths to locate executables or libraries, with the path inadvertently including directories that an attacker can modify, such as "/tmp" or the current working directory. In Windows systems, functions like LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx, when called without a fully qualified path, follow a search order that includes potentially uncontrolled directories, such as the program's loading directory or the current working directory. Similarly, Unix-based systems might mistakenly interpret an empty element in the PATH environment as the current working directory, posing a risk. Further exacerbating the problem, software package management frameworks may search public repositories before private ones, making them vulnerable to dependency confusion attacks where malicious packages with the same name as private packages are placed in public repositories to be executed unwittingly by target systems. Mitigation strategies include hard-coding search paths, using fully-qualified pathnames when invoking programs, and cleansing or restricting the environment for path settings prior to invoking external programs. Automated static analysis tools (SAST) can be effective in detecting instances of CWE-427 by analyzing source or compiled code for potentially vulnerable patterns connected to external inputs or system interactions.

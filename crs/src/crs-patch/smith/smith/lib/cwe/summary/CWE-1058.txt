CWE-1058 addresses a vulnerability arising from a function or method designed to operate in a multi-threaded environment but includes an unsafe, non-final static storable or member data element. This configuration can undermine the reliability of the product, potentially leading to vulnerabilities if attackers can access the relevant code. The core issue is categorized under Improper Synchronization (CWE-662) and is pertinent to various realms including research concepts, software development, and data protection measures as indicated by its relationships with other CWE entries. Common consequences include reduced reliability due to the likelihood of exploitation impacting the system's technical infrastructure. This weakness is an indirect ordinality, highlighting it as a quality issue that might facilitate the introduction of security-relevant weaknesses or complicate their detection. The vulnerability exemplifies a base-level abstraction problem suited for mapping to real-world vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for careful consideration to ensure appropriate mapping and prevent 'forced' mappings to lower-level Base/Variant issues.

CWE-822 describes a vulnerability arising from the incorrect handling of pointers obtained from untrusted sources. This weakness occurs when a program, without proper validation, takes a value from an external, untrusted source, converts this value into a pointer, and then proceeds to dereference it. This vulnerability can manifest in several ways, depending on how the dereferenced pointer is used. If involved in a write operation, attackers could potentially modify critical program states, induce crashes, or execute arbitrary code. In cases where the pointer is used for read operations, there's a risk of sensitive data exposure, crashes, or setting erroneous variable values due to reading from unintended memory locations. Several variants of this weakness exist, such as direct function calls using the untrusted value, crossing boundaries between userland and privileged memory in OS kernels or drivers, or accepting untrusted values in scenarios where no input was needed originally, especially in networked environments.

The security implications of CWE-822 are significant, spanning confidentiality, integrity, and availability concerns. Attackers exploiting such vulnerabilities could achieve various malicious outcomes, including unauthorized reading of memory, executing unauthorized code, modifying memory, or causing denial of service through crashes. This weakness is a base-level issue that is generally technology agnostic but has specific implications that vary depending on the context in which it is found. It is categorized under broader classes of weaknesses related to improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer, indicating a deep-seated problem with how memory operations are validated and handled.

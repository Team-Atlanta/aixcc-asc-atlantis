CWE-358 addresses the issue of improperly implemented security checks within standardized algorithms, protocols, or techniques. This weakness arises when a product either does not implement or incorrectly implements one or more security-relevant checks as specified by the standard's design. Such omissions or inaccuracies can lead to vulnerabilities in the system, opening it up to various security threats. This base-level weakness is significant because it typically describes problems across multiple dimensions, including behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. It has broad implications, affecting various aspects of security such as authentication, data authenticity, and cryptographic practices. Notably, CWE-358 can manifest in any programming language and is not tied to a specific technology, making its detection and mitigation crucial across a wide range of software and hardware products. The common consequences of this weakness include bypassing of protection mechanisms, which could compromise access control measures. Real-world vulnerabilities that map to CWE-358 have been observed in instances such as authentication bypasses due to insufficient verification, spoofing of trusted certificates due to unverified Basic Constraints, and security checks not being applied consistently across components. This weakness underscores the need for diligent implementation and verification of security checks as per the standards to prevent potential breaches.

CWE-1341 identifies a vulnerability where a program attempts to release or close a resource or handle more than once without a corresponding successful open operation in between. This condition arises when the program, after utilizing a resource like memory, files, network connections, etc., fails to properly manage the release of that resource, leading to potential undefined or insecure behavior. The issue is rooted in the expectation that resource release APIs (e.g., `free()`, `delete()`, or `close()` operations) are invoked only once for each allocation or open operation. Erroneously releasing resources multiple times could lead to various consequences including memory corruption, data corruption, or execution path corruption. This could further result in resource misuse where, due to identifier reuse, an application might erroneously consider a resource as open and attempt to close it, leading to the closing of a resource that was never intended to be closed again. Some mitigation strategies include altering the code logic to ensure resources are only released once, using flags to track resource status, and setting resource handles to `NULL` after release to prevent subsequent releases. Detection methods span automated static and dynamic analysis, with tools designed to identify such issues by analyzing code patterns or runtime behavior, respectively.

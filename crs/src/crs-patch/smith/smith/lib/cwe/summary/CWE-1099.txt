CWE-1099, identified as "Inconsistent Naming Conventions for Identifiers," denotes a base-level weakness where a software product's code, documentation, or other artifacts fail to maintain consistent naming conventions across variables, callables, related callables' groups, I/O capabilities, data types, file names, or similar types of elements. This inconsistency complicates the understanding and maintenance of a product, which indirectly impacts security by making vulnerabilities harder and more time-consuming to find and fix. It could also inadvertently facilitate the introduction of vulnerabilities. This issue is categorized under poor coding practices and is more of a quality issue without direct security implications. Despite its indirect influence on security, it is not advised to use CWE-1099 for mapping real-world vulnerabilities due to its primary focus on quality rather than direct security impact. This classification operates at a base abstraction level, emphasizing issues with behavior, property, technology, language, and resource, but with sufficient detail to suggest specific methods for detection and prevention.

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) ID 1089 addresses the issue of using large data tables equipped with an excessively large number of indices. This condition tends to degrade the performance of the software product, and if such code areas are accessible to an attacker, it could lead to potential vulnerabilities. The determination of what constitutes a "large" data table or an "excessive" number of indices may vary, but the Consortium for Information & Software Quality (CISQ) suggests using a threshold of one million rows to define a large table and more than three indices as excessive. This weakness, being at the base level of abstraction, outlines a specific method for detection and prevention while remaining mostly independent of a resource or technology. Linked to the class level weakness of Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification), it falls under the category of Bad Coding Practices in software development and is mapped to various quality measures related to performance efficiency and resource lifecycle management. Relevant guidance suggests careful consideration during the mapping of real-world vulnerabilities to ensure an appropriate fit at this preferred level of abstraction for addressing the root causes of vulnerabilities.

CWE-455, identified as "Non-exit on Failed Initialization," refers to a vulnerability related to how a product handles security-relevant errors during its initialization phase. When such errors occur—for instance, issues with configuration file formats or the activation of a hardware security module (HSM)—the product may not terminate its operation or alter its behavior as expected. Consequently, this can lead to the product operating in a less secure manner than intended by the administrator, potentially compromising the integrity of the system or allowing unintended execution logic. This weakness falls under the base level of abstraction, meaning it's moderately independent of resources or technologies but detailed enough to guide specific detection and prevention methods. It's connected to broader classes of weaknesses, including failing securely ('Failing Open'), improper initialization, and incorrect control flow scoping. The presence of this vulnerability indicates the critical importance of secure failure handling within the implementation phase, suggesting that systems should default to a secure state when encountering initialization errors to prevent potential exploits or exposure of sensitive information.

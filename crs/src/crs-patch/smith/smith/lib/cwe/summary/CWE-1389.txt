CWE-1389 refers to a vulnerability arising from the incorrect parsing of numeric inputs when different numerical bases (radices) are not properly accounted for. This weakness occurs when a system only expects decimal input but fails to consider that numerical inputs might be represented in other bases, such as octal or hexadecimal. For instance, an input starting with "0" might be treated as octal, and "0x" as hexadecimal, leading to unintended interpretations of the data. This can cause a software system to misinterpret the actual value, potentially leading to unexpected or hazardous behaviors. For example, an IP address input of "0127.0.0.1" could be misread as octal, translating to a completely different address than intended, which in turn could allow for the bypassing of access controls or enable SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attacks in web applications. The summary of potential consequences includes alterations in execution logic or the ability to read or modify protected data without authorization. Mitigation strategies involve validating input correctly, possibly by strictly enforcing decimal-based inputs or by accurately parsing inputs with different base indications (e.g., "0x" for hex), and ensuring that regular expressions used for validation are correctly bounded to prevent unexpected matches.

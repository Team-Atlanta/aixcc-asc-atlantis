CWE-764 refers to a vulnerability where a critical resource in a software system is locked multiple times unintentionally, leading to an unexpected system state. This issue is prevalent in concurrent environments, where resources are accessed by multiple processes or threads simultaneously. Depending on the type and implementation of the lock and the nature of the protected resource, the consequences of this weakness can vary. In cases involving semaphores, redundant locking attempts can deplete the resource pool, potentially causing performance degradation or denial of service. In scenarios with binary locks, subsequent locking attempts after the initial lock may fail, halting progress as the resource remains inaccessible. This vulnerability is categorized under base-level weaknesses, indicating it provides enough details for specific detection and prevention strategies while remaining somewhat independent of particular resources or technologies. The weakness is a consequence of improper synchronization, often leading to issues like denial of service or resource consumption, and poses integrity risks by putting the system in an unexpected state. To mitigate this vulnerability, developers should ensure that every lock operation on a resource is matched with a corresponding unlock operation, maintaining balance in resource management, especially in error conditions or when control paths could lead to multiple locks without matching unlocks.

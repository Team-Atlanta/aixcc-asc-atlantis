The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) definition for CWE-89 describes SQL Injection, a common software and hardware weakness. This weakness occurs when a product constructs an SQL command using externally-influenced input from upstream without properly neutralizing special elements that could modify the intended command when it is sent to downstream. A successful exploitation of this flaw could allow an attacker to alter the logic of SQL queries, bypass security checks, modify back-end database, or execute system commands posing significant threats to database-driven web sites. Lack of effective input validation or removal of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs that are likely to be interpreted as SQL instead of regular user data contributes to this insecurity. Mitigation methods include stringent input validation, output encoding, and the use of parameterized SQL statements among others.

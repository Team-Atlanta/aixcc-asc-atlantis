CWE-468, titled "Incorrect Pointer Scaling," addresses a common vulnerability found in C and C++ programming due to the way mathematical operations involving pointers are handled. This weakness stems from accidental references to incorrect memory locations caused by the languages' semantics, which often implicitly scale math operations. This issue can lead to serious vulnerabilities including buffer overflows, unauthorized memory access, and potentially, information leaks or unauthorized modification of memory. The root of the problem lies in the implicit scaling behavior of pointer arithmetic, where adding to a pointer scales the addition by the size of the data type the pointer refers to, rather than a mere byte-to-byte addition. As a consequence, operations intended to index or manipulate memory addresses directly via pointers can inadvertently lead to accessing out-of-bounds memory locations. For example, attempting to increment a pointer to access the next byte in memory might inadvertently jump further than intended, based on the size of the pointed-to type. This can compromise both the integrity and confidentiality of data by either reading from or writing to unexpected memory locations. Mitigations include using high-level memory abstractions, preferring array indexing over direct pointer manipulation, and employing technologies designed to prevent buffer overflows. This weakness, at the base level of abstraction, has wide-reaching implications, highlighting the importance of correct pointer arithmetic and memory management practices in the development of secure software.

CWE-694 addresses the issue of using multiple resources that share the same identifier within contexts that require unique identifiers for each resource. This type of oversight can lead to operational errors or security vulnerabilities, especially if the system operates under the assumption that each identifier is unique. The potential risk includes executing operations on incorrect resources, which could be exploited by attackers to bypass protection mechanisms or degrade system quality. This weakness is not specific to any programming language or technology, indicating its broad applicability across different software development contexts.

Mitigation strategies for this weakness involve the architectural and design phases, emphasizing the importance of ensuring unique identifiers for resources. If duplication is detected, the system should be designed not to proceed with operations on resources with non-unique identifiers and to report these errors appropriately. This weakness is part of a broader category of issues related to bad coding practices and data neutralization flaws, pointing towards the need for rigorous code and design review processes to prevent such vulnerabilities.

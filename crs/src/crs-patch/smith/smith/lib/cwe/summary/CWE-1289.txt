CWE-1289 deals with the improper validation of unsafe equivalence in input, where a product fails to validate or incorrectly validates that an input is equivalent to a potentially dangerous value. This vulnerability can lead to attackers bypassing input validation mechanisms by leveraging inputs that may seem benign but become malicious when processed by a lower layer or a downstream component. An example provided highlights a scenario where a simple cross-site scripting (XSS) protection mechanism might attempt to validate the absence of "<script>" tags through case-sensitive matching. However, given that HTML processing by web browsers is case-insensitive, attackers could circumvent this by injecting tags with mixed case, like "<ScrIpT>", to trigger XSS.

The CWE entry outlines that this weakness is not language-specific and may manifest during the implementation phase, suggesting a prevalent risk factor. It prescribes an "accept known good" strategy for input validation as a mitigation tactic, emphasizing the rejection or transformation of any input that does not strictly conform to specified, acceptable inputs. This approach recommends considering all relevant properties of the input, including its type, length, range of acceptable values, and adherence to business rules. The entry warns against sole reliance on identifying malicious or malformed inputs, advocating for a comprehensive input validation strategy to effectively mitigate potential attacks.

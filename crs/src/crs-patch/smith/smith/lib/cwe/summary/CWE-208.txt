CWE-208 describes a security vulnerability referred to as Observable Timing Discrepancy, which is classified under the base level of abstraction. This weakness occurs when different operations in a system require varied amounts of time to complete in a manner that is observable by an external entity. Such timing discrepancies reveal security-relevant information about the system's state, like the success or failure of an operation. This vulnerability can be particularly exploited in security-critical contexts, such as cryptographic algorithms, where attackers may infer details about private keys or other sensitive information based on the observed timing differences, thereby creating a side channel for timing attacks.

The relationships section indicates that CWE-208 is a base level weakness that can act as a parent or child in the hierarchy of weaknesses, suggesting its foundational significance in understanding and preventing a specific class of vulnerabilities. It is related to observable discrepancies and incorrect comparison logic at its core. This weakness can lead to serious consequences like unauthorized data access or bypassing protection mechanisms by exploiting the timing information. Demonstrative examples include scenarios where password validation processes reveal the correctness of partial inputs through timing, allowing attackers to incrementally guess sensitive information. The vulnerability stresses the importance of consistent operation time in security-sensitive processes to mitigate the risk of timing attacks, highlighting practices like comparing entire strings or performing operations that conceal execution time differences from attackers.

CWE-1064 identifies a software weakness where a function, subroutine, or method contains a signature with an excessive number of parameters or arguments. This issue, classified under the Base level of abstraction, detracts from the clarity and maintainability of the code, indirectly affecting security by complicating the process of finding and fixing vulnerabilities. The complexity introduced by an unusually large number of parameters can also inadvertently facilitate the introduction of security vulnerabilities. Although there is no universally accepted threshold for what constitutes an "excessive number of parameters," the Consortium for Information & Software Quality (CISQ) suggests a default maximum of seven. This weakness is understood to be more of a quality concern than a direct security threat, serving as an indirect factor that could potentially make security-relevant weaknesses harder to detect or mitigate. As such, CWE-1064 is considered a maintenance issue that underscores the importance of code simplicity and clarity as indirect contributors to software security.

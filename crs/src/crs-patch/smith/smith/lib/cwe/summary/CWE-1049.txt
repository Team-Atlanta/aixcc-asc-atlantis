CWE-1049 addresses the performance issues arising from executing data queries involving a large number of joins and sub-queries on a substantial data table. This condition can significantly slow down the product's performance and, if exploitable by an attacker, could lead to vulnerabilities. The universal indicators for a "large" data table are suggested to be around 1 million rows, with the benchmarks for a considerable number of joins and sub-queries being a minimum of 5 and 3, respectively. This weakness is cataloged under base-level abstraction due to its specific but mostly independent nature from any particular resource or technology, offering direct methodologies for detection and prevention. Furthermore, it is indirectly related to the potential for facilitating security-relevant weaknesses or concealing them, making it a pertinent consideration in the realm of security analysis and vulnerability mapping. The definition and metrics for "large" data operations derive from recommendations by CISQ, emphasizing the need for efficient data management practices to mitigate performance degradation and associated security risks.

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) ID 20 is referred to as "Improper Input Validation". It occurs when a software product receives input or data but fails to correctly validate that the input has the expected properties to be processed safely and correctly. Improper input validation can lead to a variety of issues like arbitrary control of a resource, arbitrary code execution, and system crashes. The weakness can occur with any data like metadata, raw data, strings, numbers, etc, and in any form of data structures. It also includes scenarios where the input validation process is not stringent enough to prevent vulnerabilities, such as free-form text. Due to its common misuse and broad definition, more specific CWEs or additional details about the vulnerability are recommended for actual use.

CWE-439, termed "Behavioral Change in New Version or Environment," covers a specific software weakness that emerges when an application's behavior or functionality alters with a new version of the application itself or when it's placed in a new environment, in ways that cannot be anticipated or managed by another entity (denoted as B in the description). This change is characterized as a base level weakness, implying it has sufficient specificity to guide the identification of particular methods for detection and prevention, without being tied to a specific resource or technology. The weakness encapsulates scenarios where updates or environmental changes lead to alterations that could potentially degrade the quality or performance of the software or enable other unexpected behaviors, adversely impacting users or other reliant systems.

The primary consequence of this weakness is a degradation in quality or varying impacts depending on the context, which emphasizes the importance of anticipation and management of behavioral changes across software versions and environments. This weakness is connected to broader categories like behavioral problems within software development and improper interaction between multiple correctly-behaving entities. Examples of this weakness include changes in method handling across software versions that lead to functionality becoming obsolete or incompatible without error notification, or alterations in platform sensitivity that affect file type handling. It stresses the need for vigilance and thorough testing whenever an application undergoes version updates or is deployed in new environments to ensure continuity and security of its operations.

CWE-1067 refers to a specific type of software weakness where data queries (such as those against an SQL table or view) are configured without utilizing indexes, leading to the system performing sequential searches of a data resource. This configuration error can significantly degrade the performance of the product, potentially creating a vulnerability if the problematic code is accessible by an attacker. Such a situation doesn't just impact system efficiency but may also enable various forms of exploitation depending on how the performance degradation interacts with the system's overall functionality and security measures in place.

This weakness is categorized under Base-level abstraction, indicating it's still somewhat independent of specific resources or technologies but detailed enough to provide clear methods for detection and prevention. It is a manifestation of inefficient CPU computation and is considered a part of broader categories like bad coding practices and issues related to resource lifecycle management. The main consequence of this weakness is reduced performance, which is regarded as an indirect security issue since it doesn't directly compromise security but may facilitate other vulnerabilities. Notably, CWE-1067 can be used to map real-world vulnerabilities, emphasizing its relevance in practical security contexts.

CWE-390 involves a situation where a product can detect an error condition but fails to take any action to address or handle the error, leaving the system in a potentially unstable or vulnerable state. This weakness is categorized as a base-level abstraction, indicating that it encompasses a broad spectrum of potential issues that are somewhat independent of specific technologies or resources. However, it provides enough detail to guide the detection and prevention of vulnerabilities across various dimensions such as behavior, property, and technology. It is especially relevant in scenarios where error handling is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of a system, as neglecting to properly manage error conditions can lead to unexpected states and alterations in the execution logic of applications. This can be exploited by attackers to cause undesired behavior or gain unauthorized access or control. To mitigate this type of weakness, it is essential to implement appropriate error handling mechanisms that can either resolve the error, inform the user about the issue, or safely terminate the process to prevent further complications. The examples provided demonstrate how unhandled errors in different programming languages can lead to security vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for developers to address potential error conditions during the implementation and testing phases of development to enhance the security and robustness of their applications.

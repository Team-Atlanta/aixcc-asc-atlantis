CWE-444, identified as "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')" is a security weakness that occurs when an intermediary HTTP agent (such as a proxy, firewall, or other types of HTTP middlemen), misinterprets malformed or abnormal HTTP requests/responses compared to the ultimate client or server at the end of the communication chain. This misinterpretation arises due to differences in parsing HTTP messages, which may include discrepancies in handling duplicate or contradicting headers like 'Transfer-Encoding' or 'Content-Length', leading to an inconsistency in how these messages are understood by different entities. This vulnerability allows an attacker to smuggle an HTTP message past the intermediary agent without detection, exploiting discrepancies in HTTP protocol handling. This weakness largely stems from using outdated or incompatible versions of HTTP protocols amongst the agents involved in the communication process.

The consequences of this vulnerability can be significant, allowing attackers to bypass security mechanisms, tamper with page content (e.g., web cache poisoning), gain unauthorized access, or execute cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Demonstrative examples include manipulating request headers to poison web caches or bypass firewall protections. To mitigate these weaknesses, the adoption of strict HTTP parsing procedures by web servers, use of SSL communication, session termination post-request, and making pages non-cacheable are recommended. This CWE entry, part of the broader Common Weakness Enumeration list, highlights the importance of consistent HTTP message interpretation across the data flow between clients and servers to prevent security breaches.

CWE-820 pertains to the issue of "Missing Synchronization" in software, where a product uses a shared resource concurrently without synchronizing access, leading to potential unexpected or insecure behaviors. This occurs when access to a shared resource is not properly controlled or synchronized across different threads or processes, causing the resource to be in an unexpected state. This flaw may allow attackers to manipulate the shared resource, resulting in data integrity, confidentiality breaches, or altered execution logic. The issue is broadly relevant, as itâ€™s an example of improper synchronization, a class-level weakness that could manifest in various specific vulnerabilities, including problems related to the use of singleton patterns without synchronization in a multithreaded context, unsynchronized access to shared data, and singleton class instance creation without proper locking or synchronization. Demonstrative examples include concurrent operations on standard output leading to jumbled output in a multiprocessing scenario due to lack of synchronization between parent and child processes. This weakness is a base-level concern with significant implications across software development and operational security, underscored by its inclusion in guidance documents like The CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java. Continuous research and updates have been emphasized for deeper understanding and mitigation strategies around synchronization and related mechanisms to address this and related weaknesses effectively.

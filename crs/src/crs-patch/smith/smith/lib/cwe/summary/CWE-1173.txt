CWE-1173, titled "Improper Use of Validation Framework," highlights a vulnerability due to either the non-use or incorrect utilization of input validation frameworks provided by the programming language or independent libraries. These input validation frameworks are essential as they automatically verify all input against predefined criteria and redirect to error handlers if invalid input is detected. Failure to properly implement these frameworks is not directly exploitable but can lead to vulnerabilities if adequate input validation isn't performed later in the application. Furthermore, neglecting these frameworks can diminish code maintainability since future developers might not recognize the bespoke input validation measures taken instead of using the standard framework. This CWE is categorized under base level weaknesses, indicating it has enough detail to suggest specific detection and prevention methods without being tied to a specific technology or resource. It is related to several variant weaknesses, primarily in the context of different frameworks like Struts and ASP.NET, where issues range from duplicative validation forms to misuse or non-use of validation frameworks. Potential consequences of CWE-1173 include the introduction of vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting, process control issues, and SQL injection, predominantly due to unchecked or improperly validated input. Mitigation involves the correct application of existing input validation frameworks during the implementation phase. Detection is feasible through automated static analysis, although specificity in the validation method or framework usage may limit the effectiveness, potentially leading to false positives.

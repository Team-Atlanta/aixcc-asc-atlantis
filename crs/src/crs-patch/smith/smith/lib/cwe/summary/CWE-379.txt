CWE-379 deals with a specific security weakness related to the creation of temporary files in directories with insecure permissions. This vulnerability arises when an application generates a temporary file in a location that is accessible to unintended users, potentially allowing those users to deduce the existence of the file, access its contents, or gather information about the application creating the file. The visibility of these temporary files can lead to an attacker gaining insights into the actions and behaviors of the user, thereby compromising confidentiality. This weakness is not specific to any programming language and is described as a base-level abstraction, indicating that it encompasses a broad range of applications while providing enough detail for detection and prevention strategies.

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use contemporary programming practices and functions that handle temporary files securely, avoid using vulnerable temp file functions, and, wherever possible, store sensitive temporary files in directories not accessible to all users. Detection methods include automated static analysis with high effectiveness, highlighting potentially vulnerable patterns in source or binary code. Examples of this vulnerability and potential mitigations highlight the risk associated with default temporary file directories on various operating systems, such as "/tmp" on UNIX or "C:\\Windows\\Temp" on Windows, which are easily accessible by attackers. Proper handling of temporary files is crucial to securing applications against unintended access and information disclosure.

CWE-549 identifies a security weakness where password fields in a software application are not masked (hidden) during user entry. This flaw significantly increases the risk of unauthorized observation and capture of passwords by attackers, compromising user accounts and sensitive information. This base-level weakness, being technology and resource agnostic, provides specific detection and prevention methods. It falls under the broader category of insufficiently protected credentials (CWE-522) and is related to errors in credentials management (CWE-255) and user interface security issues (CWE-355). To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended that developers ensure all password fields in web applications are masked to obscure passwords from view. Automated static analysis tools can effectively detect instances of this weakness by examining source code for patterns that may lead to the exposure of password fields. This CWE entry is crucial for securing user authentication mechanisms by preventing easy access to password information through the application's interface.

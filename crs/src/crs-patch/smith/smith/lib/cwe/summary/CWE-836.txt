CWE-836 addresses a critical security flaw where authentication mechanisms improperly rely on client-generated password hashes for verification against server-stored hashes. This flaw emerges from the mistaken belief that comparing hashed passwords, rather than plain-text passwords, enhances security. However, this practice exposes systems to severe risks since attackers can intercept or retrieve the hash (e.g., through SQL injection or information leaks) and use it to authenticate as though they possess the actual password. As such, requiring a client to compute the hash before transmission does not substantially improve security over transmitting passwords in plain text, as it allows an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms without needing to know the original password. This issue is a base-level weakness, indicating it provides enough detail to outline specific detection and prevention methods across various dimensions such as behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. The CWE definition cautions against the simplistic use of hashed passwords for authentication by highlighting that, without additional security measures, hashes can be as vulnerable as the passwords they derive from.

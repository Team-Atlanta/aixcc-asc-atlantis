CWE-1123 addresses the excessive use of self-modifying code within software, identifying it as a base-level weakness with implications for both security and maintainability. Self-modifying code, which alters itself during execution, can substantially hinder the readability, understanding, and maintenance of a product. This complexity not only makes it more challenging to identify and rectify vulnerabilities but may also inadvertently facilitate the introduction of new security flaws. The primary concern related to this weakness is its potential to degrade the maintainability of the software, thereby indirectly increasing the risk of security vulnerabilities remaining undetected or unresolved. As a base-level weakness, CWE-1123 is recognized for contributing to a higher likelihood of security-related issues due to the indirect manner in which it affects software quality, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and mapping to ensure accurate identification and mitigation in the context of real-world vulnerabilities.

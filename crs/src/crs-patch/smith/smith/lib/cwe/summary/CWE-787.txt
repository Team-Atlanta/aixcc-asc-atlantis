Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-787, also known as Out-of-bounds Write, is a software vulnerability that occurs when data is written past the end, or before the beginning, of the allocated buffer. This can cause data corruption, system crash, or unauthorized code execution. This might happen due to incorrect management of an index or pointer arithmetic, which leads to the referencing of a memory location that is outside the buffer boundaries. The subsequent write operation can produce undefined or unexpected results. This vulnerability is typically related to memory corruption or buffer overflow issues. Mitigation strategies could involve language selection, use of libraries or frameworks that prevent this weakness, and adhering to proper memory allocation and management rules. Automated static analysis and dynamic analysis tools can be used to detect this weakness.

CWE-767 refers to the software weakness where a critical private variable can be accessed or manipulated through a public method. This vulnerability can arise if, for instance, a private variable, which was intended to be protected and only accessible within the same class or module, is exposed through a public accessor or mutator method without proper restrictions or validation. The primary concern is that if an attacker is able to modify the critical variable, it could result in unexpected behavior or violate assumptions made by the program, potentially leading to further vulnerabilities. Conversely, if an attacker can read the variable, it might disclose sensitive information or facilitate additional attacks. This weakness is mostly language-agnostic, with examples provided for C++ and Java, indicating its relevance across different programming environments.

Mitigation strategies for CWE-767 involve using class accessors (getters) and mutators (setters) appropriately to control access to private variables, validating inputs rigorously when data is accepted through public methods, and ensuring that proper access controls are enforced to protect critical data. Related weaknesses and categories include exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor, and this type of vulnerability is particularly concerning for software development, where it can lead to integrity and confidentiality breaches. The taxonomy and examples outlined in CWE-767 highlight the importance of secure coding practices and the need for vigilance in how accessible variables are to unauthorized or unintended access within software applications.

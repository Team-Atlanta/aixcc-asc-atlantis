CWE-1220 describes a vulnerability due to Insufficient Granularity of Access Control, regarded as a base-level weakness that can manifest in software and hardware systems aiming to disable or restrict access to system assets from untrusted agents. The heart of this vulnerability lies in the implemented access controls lacking the required granularity, resulting in controls that are too broad, thereby allowing unauthorized agent access to security-sensitive assets. Access controls typically start with default configurations and are intended to be set more restrictively by trusted firmware upon system initialization. However, a common pitfall is the creation of access control policies that are not granular enough, allowing more extensive access than intended. This could potentially lead to security risks such as the leakage of sensitive information, unauthorized modification of device configurations, or other exploitations leading to a loss of functionality or compromised device setup.

The vulnerability is highly relevant in the context of integrated circuits and hardware engines that expose asset access to trusted software modulesâ€”often set by BIOS or bootloaders under specific access control policies. The weakness outlines scenarios where the granularity of access control does not adequately restrict actions (e.g., reads and writes) to assets, thus potentially enabling unauthorized access by agents beyond those trusted. Such a condition can surface at various stages including hardware architecture and design, or implementation, with severe consequences for confidentiality, integrity, availability, and a breach of access control principles. This could lead to technical impacts like unauthorized code execution, privilege escalation, or bypassing of protection mechanisms. The description emphasizes the importance of designing and implementing access control with adequate granularity to ensure that access permissions are appropriately restrictive and aligned with security policies, suggesting that mitigation involves reviewing and testing access-control-policy protections across design, implementation, and testing phases.

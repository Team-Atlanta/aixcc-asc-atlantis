CWE-241, titled "Improper Handling of Unexpected Data Type," addresses a software weakness where a product does not correctly handle cases when an element is not of the expected type. Specifically, it points to situations where the system anticipates a particular type of input, such as a digit (0-9), but receives an unexpected type, like a letter (A-Z), instead. This base-level weakness, mostly independent of specific resources or technology, provides sufficient detail for identifying specific detection and prevention methods. It falls into broader class-level weaknesses related to "Improper Handling of Syntactically Invalid Structure" and is a member of the category "Data Processing Errors" within software development. 

The consequence of such a vulnerability can vary greatly depending on the context, potentially leading to an unexpected state or other impacts on the integrity of the application. Observations of this weakness include instances where non-numeric input caused crashes or assert errors in systems, demonstrating the real-world implications. Mitigation strategies emphasize input validation, advocating for an "accept known good" approach where only inputs that conform strictly to specifications are accepted or transformed into compliant inputs. This involves considering all potentially relevant properties of the input, including type, length, and syntax, among others. The CWE entry suggests that this issue might be under-studied, indicating a need for more research and attention from security professionals.

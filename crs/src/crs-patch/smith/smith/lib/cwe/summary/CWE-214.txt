CWE-214 deals with the security weakness where sensitive information, such as credentials or environmental variables, is passed to a process during its invocation in a manner that makes this information visible to other users on the system. Operating systems often allow users to view process-related information, including command line arguments or environment variables of processes owned by other users. When this process-invoked data contains sensitive information, it poses a security risk as it could allow unauthorized users to view this information and potentially exploit it to compromise the product or related systems. This vulnerability stems from an implementation issue where sensitive information is not adequately protected during the process invocation, making it accessible to local users through standard utilities that list process information. Common consequences of this weakness include the breach of confidentiality, leading to unauthorized access to application data. To mitigate this threat, it is crucial to avoid passing sensitive information in command lines or environmental variables that can be exposed to other users on the system.

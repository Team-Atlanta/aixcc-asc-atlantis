CWE-625 involves a security weakness where a product uses a permissive regular expression that fails to adequately limit the set of allowed inputs. This weakness primarily stems from regular expressions that are too broad and lack specific constraints, thus accepting inputs that match only part of the desired pattern. This can lead to various security vulnerabilities as the regular expression does not correctly define the start and end of the string, may use wildcards excessively instead of defined character ranges, or may not properly delineate the expected input format. Such weaknesses could potentially allow attackers to bypass input validation mechanisms, leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of system functions. Common implementation flaws include failure to specify the beginning and end of the input string and the misuse of character classes or quantifiers, resulting in patterns that can be easily evaded or exploited by malicious inputs. This weakness is conceptually related to issues like incorrect regular expression (CWE-185), absence of regular expression anchors (CWE-777), and partial string comparison vulnerabilities (CWE-187). It most frequently arises during the implementation phase, particularly when regular expressions are employed for input validation or security controls, across a range of programming languages such as Perl and PHP. Potential mitigation strategies include ensuring the regular expression accurately specifies the start and end of the pattern to be matched, thereby preventing unintended matches.

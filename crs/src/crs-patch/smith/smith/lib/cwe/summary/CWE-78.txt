The bug titled CWE-78 refers to the "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command" also known as "OS Command Injection." This weakness occurs when a software constructs an OS command using externally influenced input from an upstream component without neutralizing or incorrectly neutralizing special elements that could modify the intended OS command. This allows attackers to execute unexpected, harmful commands directly on the operating system. It may allow attackers to perform actions with a higher privilege level if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege. There are two main types of command injection: one where the application intends to execute a single fixed program with externally supplied inputs as arguments, and other where the application accepts an input which is used to select the program to run and its commands, this redirects the entire command to the operating system, allowing potential for compromise.

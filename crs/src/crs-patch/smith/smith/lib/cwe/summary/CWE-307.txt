CWE-307, titled "Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts," outlines a software vulnerability where a system fails to limit or adequately control the number of failed authentication attempts within a specific time frame. This weakness makes the system vulnerable to brute force attacks, where attackers try various password combinations until they succeed in gaining unauthorized access. The vulnerability is categorized under 'Base' in the abstraction model, indicating it provides enough detail for specific detection and prevention methods across different technologies and resources. This weakness is crucial as it directly affects access control, potentially allowing attackers to bypass security mechanisms by performing an arbitrary number of authentication attempts. Real-world instances, like the 2009 Twitter incident, demonstrate the potential for significant breaches when this vulnerability is exploited, leading to unauthorized access to high-profile accounts by guessing passwords through a brute force attack. Mitigations for this vulnerability include implementing mechanisms like disconnecting users after several failed attempts, introducing time delays, account lockouts, or requiring additional computational tasks for authentication attempts. Identification and prevention strategies involve using dynamic and static analysis tools, code reviews, and employing third-party libraries or frameworks with secure authentication mechanisms.

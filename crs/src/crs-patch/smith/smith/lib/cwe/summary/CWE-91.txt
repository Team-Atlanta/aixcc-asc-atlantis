CWE-91, titled "XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection)," refers to a vulnerability stemming from the improper handling or neutralization of special elements within XML documents by a product. This flaw allows attackers to modify the intended syntax, content, or commands of XML before it is processed by an end system, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution, data leakage, or data modification. Key elements of concern within XML include reserved words or characters like "<", ">", "\"", and "&". These can be exploited to add new data or alter the structure and syntax of the XML document.

The weakness is classified as a "Base" level in terms of abstraction, indicating that while it is somewhat independent of specific resources or technologies, it contains enough detail to inform specific detection and prevention methods across several dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. It is a subclass of "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')" but more specifically relates to XML data. Mitigation strategies primarily involve thorough input validation, adopting an "accept known good" approach, and ensuring input conforms strictly to specifications. The impact of exploiting this vulnerability spans across confidentiality, integrity, and availability, making it essential for developers and security professionals to address this weakness to prevent potential security breaches.

CWE-374 refers to the vulnerability when mutable objects are passed as arguments to untrusted methods or functions, without making a clone of the data. This situation creates a risk because the external code that's called can modify or delete the mutable data, undermining assumptions about the state of the data by the calling function. This type of vulnerability, which is more conceptual and operational in nature, predominantly affects programming languages like C, C++, Java, and C#. The essence of this vulnerability lies in its capacity to compromise data integrity by allowing potentially unauthorized modifications. Mitigation strategies include treating data that shouldn't be altered as constant or immutable, and cloning all mutable data before passing it to an external function. This ensures that even if the external code modifies the data, the original class retains a valid copy for its use. The bug demonstrates the principle that, especially in languages where passing by reference is the norm for objects, making defensive copies of objects before passing them into methods can prevent unintended side effects, thereby preserving the integrity and consistency of the program's state.

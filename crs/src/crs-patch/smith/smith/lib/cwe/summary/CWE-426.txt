CWE-426, Untrusted Search Path, is a security weakness that occurs when a product searches for critical resources using a search path supplied from an external source, which could lead to the use of resources not under the product's control. This vulnerability can allow attackers to execute their own code, access unauthorized data files, or alter the product's configuration in unforeseen ways. For example, if the product uses a search path to locate important programs, an attacker might manipulate that search path to point to a malicious program, leading to its execution. This issue is particularly prevalent on UNIX, Linux, and Microsoft-based systems where environment variables such as PATH or LD_PRELOAD are used to find executable programs or libraries. The consequences of such a vulnerability can be severe, including unauthorized code execution, denial of service, or confidential information disclosure. Mitigation strategies involve hard-coding search paths to known-safe directories, specifying programs with fully-qualified pathnames, sanitizing the environment before launching external programs, and verifying search paths for safety. Detection methods include using automated static analysis tools, manual analysis, and monitoring software process interactions with the operating system and network for suspicious behavior.

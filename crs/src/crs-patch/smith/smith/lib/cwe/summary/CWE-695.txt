CWE-695 focuses on the misuse of low-level functionality in software development, which goes against the intended framework or specification guidelines. This kind of misuse can lead to a wide array of problems, such as weakening the built-in security protections inherent in higher-level abstractions, creating exploitable inconsistencies, or exposing sensitive functionality to potential attacks. Essentially, by dipping into lower-level operations, software developers might inadvertently bypass the layers of security and correctness guarantees provided by higher-level language constructs or frameworks. This issue is especially pertinent in environments where a mix of high-level and low-level languages are used, such as Java calling native C or C++ code through the Java Native Interface (JNI). Such practices, if not carefully managed, can introduce severe vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, even within systems that are generally considered safe from such issues, due to the memory safety and management features of higher-level languages. The relationships section of CWE-695 elaborates on this weakness being a parent to various specific instances, including direct use of unsafe JNI and improper handling of threads, sockets, or I/O operations that typically require careful synchronization and memory management, practices often mishandled in lower-level languages. Detection of such misuse is highly feasible through automated static analysis, emphasizing the importance of tool-supported reviews in modern software development cycles to identify and mitigate these risks.

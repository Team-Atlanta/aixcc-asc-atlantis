CWE-256 concerns the security weakness associated with the plaintext storage of passwords within software or hardware systems. This vulnerability arises from storing passwords without encryption, making them accessible and readable directly from the application's properties, configuration files, or memory. Such practices could lead to unauthorized access if an individual, such as a malicious employee or external attacker, gains access to these plaintext passwords. Not only does this expose password-protected resources to potential compromise, but it also violates fundamental security principles by not adequately protecting credentials. This issue is identified as a base level weakness, indicating it provides enough detail for specific detection and prevention methods, yet remains somewhat independent of the resource or technology involved. The plaintext storage of passwords can lead to significant consequences including unauthorized privilege escalation and identity assumption. Mitigating this vulnerability involves avoiding the storage of passwords in easily accessible or unencrypted formats, opting for cryptographic hash storage, or implementing more secure password management strategies to prevent easy exploitation by attackers.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of security vulnerability where a web server fails to verify whether a request was intentionally sent by the user. An attacker can trick a client into making an unintentional request that will be seen as a genuine one by the server, which can potentially lead to unauthorized data exposure or unintended code execution. This vulnerability is relevant to class-level weaknesses and requires specific methodologies for detection and prevention. Various mitigation strategies include using vetted libraries or frameworks, ensuring the application is free of cross-site scripting issues (CWE-79), and generating unique nonces for each form.

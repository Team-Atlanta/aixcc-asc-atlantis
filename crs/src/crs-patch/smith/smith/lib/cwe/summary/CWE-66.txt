Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) number 66, titled "Improper Handling of File Names that Identify Virtual Resources," addresses a fundamental flaw relating to the management of file names that represent virtual resources, which are not directly referenced within the file system's directory structure. This weakness manifests in software when it fails to appropriately manage or mistakenly handles such virtual file names, inadvertently leading to file operations being conducted on non-file entities. Virtual file names act as aliases for resources differing in behavior from standard files and may not be visibly listed within directories, making them functionally distinct and potentially susceptible to security vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability stems from a base-level abstraction, indicating that while it remains relatively independent of specific resources or technologies, it is described with enough detail to inform detection and prevention methods. This weakness has been identified as a parent to several variant weaknesses, including those involving improper handling of specific operating system device names and alternate data streams properties in various file systems. The exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to a range of impacts, including unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, as demonstrated by several noted CVE instances. Defense against such vulnerabilities involves a multi-faceted approach to detection, ranging from automated and manual static analysis of source code and binaries to dynamic analysis with both automated and manual interpretation, highlighting the importance of comprehensive security practices in software development and operations.

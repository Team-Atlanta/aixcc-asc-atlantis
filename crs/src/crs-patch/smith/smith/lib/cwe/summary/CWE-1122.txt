CWE-1122, titled "Excessive Halstead Complexity," identifies a specific software weakness characterized by code that has a Halstead complexity measure beyond a desirable maximum. The Halstead complexity measures, which include metrics such as program vocabulary size and volume, offer a quantitative analysis of the software's complexity. When complexity exceeds practical limits, it significantly hampers the understandability and maintainability of the product. This indirectly impacts security, as it becomes increasingly challenging and time-consuming to identify and rectify vulnerabilities. The elevated complexity may also inadvertently facilitate the introduction of new vulnerabilities. This weakness is primarily a quality concern without direct security implications but acts as an indirect factor that could weaken security by complicating vulnerability detection and resolution processes. It is highlighted that this CWE should not be used for mapping real-world vulnerabilities, as it pertains more to code quality issues than direct security threats.

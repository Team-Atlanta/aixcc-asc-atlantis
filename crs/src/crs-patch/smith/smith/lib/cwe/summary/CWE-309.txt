CWE-309, identified as "Use of Password System for Primary Authentication," outlines significant vulnerabilities associated with relying solely on password systems for authentication. This weakness is tagged at the Base level of abstraction, highlighting issues that maintain mostly technology-independent characteristics but are detailed enough to inform specific detection and prevention methods. The core of CWE-309's concern lies in the several flaws or shortcomings inherent in password systems, which reduce their effectiveness as the sole method of authentication. Password systems, being the simplest and most ubiquitous form of authentication, are frequently compromised through well-known attacks, rendering their simplest implementations impractical for secure authentication.

The vulnerability is linked to several related weaknesses, such as reliance on a single factor in a security decision (CWE-654) and weak authentication (CWE-1390), underscoring the broader implications of inadequate authentication mechanisms. The susceptibility of password systems to compromise necessitates a series of mitigations during the architecture and design phase. These include safely storing passwords in a non-retrievable format, enforcing password aging and strength, and educating users about the importance of secure password practices. Additional recommendations involve implementing zero-knowledge password protocols and mechanisms for assessing password strength to bolster the security of authentication processes. Despite the high likelihood of exploit, detailed preventive measures and potential mitigations are outlined, emphasizing a multifaceted approach to reinforcing password systems against unauthorized access and ensuring robust authentication practices.

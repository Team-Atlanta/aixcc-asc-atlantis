CWE-325, labeled as "Missing Cryptographic Step," is a base-level classification that highlights a vulnerability concerning the omission of a crucial step in a cryptographic algorithm. This gap results in the affected encryption being weaker than what the algorithm is supposed to achieve. Essentially, this vulnerability revolves around the failure to implement a necessary component of the cryptographic process, leading to potentially compromised encryption strength.

This weakness is primarily introduced during the implementation phase, where developers might skip certain resource-intensive steps to enhance performance, especially in scenarios involving devices with constrained resources such as limited memory or lower processing capabilities. Sometimes, this omission is due to a misunderstanding of the algorithm's requirements, which might not have been clearly defined. The absence of these critical steps in cryptographic routines can lead to several adverse outcomes, including the bypass of access controls, unauthorized data modification or access, and the undermining of data integrity and authentication processes. An illustrative example provided involves the HMAC engine within the OpenPiton System-on-Chip (SoC), which inadequately handles messages longer than 512 bits due to omitting an iterative hash function, showcasing a real-world implication of this vulnerability. Identifying and mitigating such vulnerabilities are crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of cryptographic implementations.

CWE-918, known as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), is a security weakness characterized by a web server receiving a URL or similar request from an upstream component and then retrieving the contents of this URL without sufficiently ensuring that the request is being sent to the expected destination. Attackers can exploit this weakness by providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, making it appear that the server is sending the request, which can bypass certain access controls such as firewalls. This can lead to the server being used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, get access to system documents through different URLs or use other protocols for greater control over the requests. The weakness is not language-specific and can impact the confidentiality and the integrity of the system, leading to unauthorized access of application data or execution of unauthorized code or commands.

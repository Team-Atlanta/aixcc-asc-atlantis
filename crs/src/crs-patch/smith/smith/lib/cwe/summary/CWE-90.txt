CWE-90, also known as LDAP Injection, is identified under the Common Weakness Enumeration categorization as a "Base" level weakness. This vulnerability arises when software constructs all or part of an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) query using input from an upstream component without properly neutralizing special elements. Such failure in neutralizing special characters or patterns in the input can cause the software to execute unintended LDAP queries when the input is incorporated into the LDAP statement. This can lead to various security issues, including unauthorized code execution, data leakage or modification, and other unintended behaviors, thereby compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application data.

The root of this issue generally occurs during the implementation phase, where developers do not validate or sanitize user-supplied inputs before using them in LDAP queries. This negligence provides an attacker with the opportunity to include harmful inputs that could modify the LDAP query, leading to an injection attack. Mitigation strategies include rigorous input validation, using lists of allowable inputs that conform strictly to the expected specifications, and rejecting or transforming inputs that do not meet these criteria. Additionally, understanding and implementing proper sanitation and validation techniques can significantly decrease the likelihood of exploitation. Detection methods highlighted include the use of Automated Static Analysis tools (SAST) which can identify instances of potential LDAP Injection by analyzing the source code without executing the program, showcasing a high effectiveness in identifying such vulnerabilities.

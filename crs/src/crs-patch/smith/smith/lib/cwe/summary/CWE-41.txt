CWE-41, titled "Improper Resolution of Path Equivalence," identifies a vulnerability stemming from the mishandling of special characters in file and directory names within a system, leading to potential unauthorized disclosure of file system contents. The core issue involves path equivalence, where manipulations involving special characters create multiple names for the same object in an attempt to bypass access controls. This method relies on exploiting an incomplete set of file name or file path representations to access otherwise restricted content. Notably, path equivalence differs from path traversal, as the former manipulates names to reference the same object rather than attempting to access a different object. The vulnerability indicates a base level weakness, which suggests it is somewhat independent of specific technologies yet detailed enough to guide towards detection and prevention methods.

Exploiting the path equivalence can lead to severe consequences such as reading, modifying files or directories, or bypassing protection mechanisms. For instance, attackers could traverse the filesystem to read or overwrite files in unintended locations. This could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and access controls of the system, especially if the files are related to security mechanisms. The vulnerability encompasses various variant weaknesses related to how different special characters like dots, spaces, and slashes are handled within paths. Mitigation strategies include rigorous input validation to reject or transform inputs not strictly conforming to specified patterns and output encoding tailored to the expected downstream components to prevent injection attacks. Detecting this class of vulnerabilities can be approached through a combination of static and dynamic analysis, source code review, and adherence to secure coding standards which emphasize validation and canonicalization of input paths.

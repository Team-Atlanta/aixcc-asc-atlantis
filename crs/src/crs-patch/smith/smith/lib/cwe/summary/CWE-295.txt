CWE-295 describes the security weakness of improper certificate validation, categorized under Base level abstraction, highlighting it as a flaw that remains mostly independent of a resource or technology yet provides enough detail for specific detection and prevention methods. This weakness involves a product failing to validate or incorrectly validating a certificate, which could enable attackers to spoof a trusted entity by interfering with the communication path between the host and client. As a consequence, the product may connect to a malicious host under the belief it is trusted or accept spoofed data perceived to be from a trusted source. This weakness is seen as a base for several related security issues, including improper following of a certificate's chain of trust, improper validation of certificate with host mismatch, incorrect validation of certificate expiration, and inadequate checks for certificate revocation, among others. Common consequences of exploiting this weakness include bypassing protection mechanisms and assuming identity, fundamentally jeopardizing the integrity and authentication processes of applications. It's vital in software development and design to thoroughly manage and verify certificates to ensure data encryption aligns with the intended recipient's public key, especially if certificate pinning is utilized, to prevent this class of vulnerabilities.

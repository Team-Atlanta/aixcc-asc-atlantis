CWE-663 highlights the security risk associated with using non-reentrant functions in a concurrent context. Non-reentrant functions, when called simultaneously from multiple threads or signal handlers, can lead to unpredictable behavior or system vulnerabilities since they are not designed to handle concurrent executions. This can result in the corruption of data, unintended memory or application data modifications, or alterations in execution logic, posing significant integrity and confidentiality risks. Common manifestations of this issue include unsafe calls to library functions from signal handlers and the use of non-reentrant functions like `getlogin()` in multithreaded applications. Demonstrative examples provided elucidate scenarios where concurrent invocation of such functions leads to undefined and potentially exploitable states. Recommended mitigations emphasize the importance of using reentrant counterparts if available, adding synchronization mechanisms, or, in languages like Java, utilizing specific classes designed for concurrency, such as ReentrantLock. This weakness, identified at a base level of abstraction, is crucial for developers to understand and address to prevent exploitable vulnerabilities in software applications.

CWE-359 addresses the exposure of private personal information to unauthorized parties, which is a significant security vulnerability that can affect both software and hardware systems. This type of vulnerability appears when a product fails to adequately safeguard an individual's private and personal information from access by entities that are either not expressly authorized or do not have implicit consent from the individuals concerned. Private personal information encompasses a wide array of data types, including but not limited to government identifiers (like Social Security Numbers), contact information, geographic location, employment history, financial data, personal media (photos, videos, audio), behavioral patterns, relationships, communications (such as emails, text messages), health information, and account credentials. It's critical to recognize that the exposure of such information might not impede the product's functionality and, in some cases, could be a deliberate act by the developers for purposes like data sharing. Nonetheless, unauthorized disclosure of personal information can lead to severe privacy violations and might be subject to legal consequences depending on the jurisdiction and applicable laws or regulations.

This vulnerability arises from different phases in the development cycle, especially during architecture and design, due to omission of adequate security measures. It's paramount in the requirements phase to identify and adhere to relevant privacy regulations (like GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA, among others) to ensure compliance and safeguard personal information effectively. From a design perspective, there needs to be a careful balance between security measures and privacy considerations, as misplacement of trust in the security of storage mediums (such as file systems or databases) for private data can lead to privacy risks. Detection of such vulnerabilities requires high-effectiveness techniques like architecture or design review and automated static analysis, which can trace how private data flows through and exits the software, potentially exposing sensitive information.

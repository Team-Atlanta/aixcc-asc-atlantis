CWE-1043 addresses a software weakness characterized by the utilization of data elements that aggregate an excessively large number of non-primitive sub-elements, such as structures or objects. This configuration can significantly slow down product performance, and if such code areas are accessible to attackers, it might escalate into a vulnerability. The interpretation of "excessively large" varies, but CISQ suggests a default threshold of 5 sub-elements as a starting point. This particular weakness is a base-level issue, meaning it's somewhat independent of the technology or resource being used but detailed enough to discuss specific prevention and detection methods. It's categorized under classes like Excessively Complex Data Representation and is linked to broader categories involving bad coding practices and complexity issues. Despite its potential to indirectly facilitate the introduction of security-relevant weaknesses, CWE-1043 itself is primarily considered a quality issue rather than a direct security threat. Consequently, it's recommended not to use CWE-1043 for mapping real-world vulnerabilities directly due to its nature as a quality concern without immediate security implications.

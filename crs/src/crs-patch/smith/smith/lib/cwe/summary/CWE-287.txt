Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-287 refers to improper authentication. It occurs when a software product fails to sufficiently prove or verify claims of a given identity. This weakness can lead to unauthorized access to resources or data, granting attackers the chance to gain privileges, execute unauthorized commands, or read application data. It often stems from faulty implementation of an architectural security tactic and can be caused during implementation. This issue is not language-specific and is often prevalent in Industrial Control Systems (ICS/Operational Technology (OT) technologies. CWE-287 can result in significant integrity, confidentiality, access control, and availability issues, with a high likelihood of being exploited. These errors are caused by a range of underlying issues, including bypassing authentication checks, brute force attacks, and improperly implemented security measures. It is highly recommended to use an authentication framework or library to mitigate such issues.

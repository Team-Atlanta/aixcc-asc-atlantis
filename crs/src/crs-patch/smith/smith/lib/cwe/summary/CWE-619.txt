CWE-619, identified as Dangling Database Cursor or "Cursor Injection," highlights a significant vulnerability stemming from improperly closed database cursors. A cursor, which facilitates executing and accessing SQL query results, may remain accessible to unintended users with its original privileges if not adequately closed. This vulnerability can manifest notably through unhandled exceptions, rendering systems susceptible to SQL injection attacks, among other security threats. The essence of the issue lies in the cursor operating beyond its intended scope without proper closure, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation. Mitigation strategies primarily involve ensuring cursors are promptly closed after use, especially following exceptions, to maintain the intended security boundaries and prevent exploitation. This weakness is part of a broader category involving resource management errors and is applicable mainly to systems utilizing SQL, underlining the critical necessity of diligent resource management within software development to safeguard against such vulnerabilities.

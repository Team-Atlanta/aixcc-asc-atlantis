CWE-909 addresses the issue of missing initialization of a resource, classified as an abstraction-level weakness that is described in a very general manner, typically technology or language-independent. This problem occurs when a critical resource in software or hardware is not properly initialized before its use. Proper initialization of resources is essential as it prepares them for operation, ensuring they contain predictable data or are set to valid default values. If a resource is left uninitialized, it may contain arbitrary or expired data, or it might be set to defaults that are incorrect or insecure, leading to unpredictable behavior or security vulnerabilities. This can significantly impact the confidentiality and availability of data, potentially allowing unauthorized reading of memory or application data, or causing crashes, exits, or restarts due to the program operating on unexpected values. Mitigation strategies involve explicit resource initialization before use, cautious handling of complex conditional logic that could bypass initialization, avoiding race conditions during initialization, and utilizing compiler or runtime warnings to detect uninitialized data usage. Examples provided illustrate various scenarios where missing initialization leads to security flaws, including bypassing access restrictions, unintended privilege escalation, leakage of sensitive information, and undefined behavior leading to potential crashes or data corruption.

The CWE-276 security bug, also known as Incorrect Default Permissions, generally occurs during system installation when the installed file permissions are set to a lax standard, allowing anyone to modify those files. The bug has a medium likelihood of being exploited and primarily threatens confidentiality and integrity of the system data. If successful, the attacker can read, and alter application data. The bug is not specific to any language or technology, hence can appear in various environments. A general mitigation strategy emphasizes on setting access and modification rights for files strictly to users who really need those privileges and compartmentalizing the system into 'safe' areas with clear trust boundaries. Automated static and dynamic analysis and architecture or design review are some effective detection methods for this weakness.

CWE-1288 refers to the improper validation of consistency within input, where a product receives complex input consisting of multiple elements or fields that need to be consistent with each other, but fails to adequately validate this consistency. This sort of vulnerability arises when input data structured with multiple interdependent elements or fields, such as a field indicating a number of items that is followed by the actual items, is either not validated for consistency or is incorrectly validated. Attackers can exploit these inconsistencies to trigger errors, cause unintended actions, or exploit hidden vulnerabilities, which can have various consequences depending on the context in which they are exploited. Effective mitigation involves adopting a strategy of input validation that assumes all input is potentially malicious. This involves validating all input against a set of rigorously defined specifications for what constitutes acceptable input, covering aspects such as length, type, range of acceptable values, and conformance to business rules, among others. The use of allowlists for input validation is advocated over reliance on denylists, as the latter might not cover all potentially harmful inputs and could give attackers opportunities to bypass security measures.

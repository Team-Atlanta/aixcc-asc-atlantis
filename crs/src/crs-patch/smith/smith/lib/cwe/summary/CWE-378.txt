CWE-378 addresses the creation of temporary files with insecure permissions, which forms a base-level weakness impacting software and hardware security by providing attackers opportunities to exploit the file's contents and functions. It highlights how temporary files, when opened without proper security measures, become vulnerable to unauthorized access and manipulation. These vulnerabilities manifest from implementation flaws where temporary files are created in a manner that allows attackers to read or write to these files, potentially leading to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, alteration of data integrity, or elevation of privileges by exploiting the insecure file permissions. The weakness is not language-specific and affects multiple operating systems, emphasizing the ubiquity and severity of the risk across platforms. Mitigation strategies include using safer temporary file creation methods that support secure permissions by default, randomizing temporary filenames to avoid predictable locations, and ensuring that temporary files are readable and writable only by the owner process to protect against unauthorized access and modifications. These practices aim to diminish the likelihood of exploitation, which is considered high for this type of vulnerability.

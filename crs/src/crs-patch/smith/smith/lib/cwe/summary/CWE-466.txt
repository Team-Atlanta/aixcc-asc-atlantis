CWE-466 concerns a software weakness where a function returns a pointer to a memory location that is outside the intended buffer space. This base-level weakness, categorized under "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer" (CWE-119), can lead to errors where programs access memory locations they are not supposed to, potentially leading to confidentiality and integrity breaches by reading from or modifying unintended memory areas. This issue is particularly relevant in languages like C and C++, where pointer use and memory management are common sources of vulnerabilities. The description highlights that this weakness may be inadvertently introduced during the implementation phase of development and emphasizes the importance of accurate and careful mappings to corresponding vulnerabilities for effective identification and prevention. Additionally, CWE-466 is noted for its relation to broader categories of weaknesses related to pointer issues and memory safety and is mentioned in several contexts, including the CERT C and C++ Secure Coding Standards.

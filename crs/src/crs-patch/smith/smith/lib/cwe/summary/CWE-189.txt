The CWE category for Numeric Errors, identified as Category ID 189, encapsulates a range of weaknesses related to the improper calculation or conversion of numbers. These weaknesses are a critical component of software and hardware vulnerabilities that, if not addressed, can lead to various types of errors and potential system compromises. This category includes several base weaknesses such as wrap-around errors, integer overflow or wraparound, integer underflow, off-by-one errors, divide by zero, incorrect conversion between numeric types, numeric range comparison without minimum check, incorrect bitwise shift of integer, insufficient precision or accuracy of a real number, incorrect parsing of numbers with different radices, and more. Essentially, these errors originate from the improper handling of numeric values, leading to unexpected behavior or system states. Notably, this CWE ID is not to be used for mapping real-world vulnerabilities directly, as it serves as an aggregate category for organizing related weaknesses rather than a specific weakness itself. The practice of using categories for mapping has been discouraged due to their broad and non-specific nature. Instead, more specific descendants under categories like Incorrect Calculation or Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types are preferred for accurately identifying and addressing weaknesses.

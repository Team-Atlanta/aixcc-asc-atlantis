CWE-267, titled "Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions," concerns a security weakness where certain privileges, roles, capabilities, or rights enable the performance of unsafe actions unintended by the designers, even when these privileges are assigned to the intended entity. This issue belongs to the Base level of abstraction, indicating it is somewhat independent of specific technologies but detailed enough to suggest methods for detection and prevention. It acts as a parent to more specific variants like the unsafe ActiveX control marked safe for scripting, highlighting its role in a broader class of privilege management issues. Examples of this weakness include allowing non-admin users to access or execute administrative functions or information inadvertently, leading to potential unauthorized gains in privilege or identity assumption. Mitigation strategies involve careful management of privileges, trust zones, and adhering to the principle of least privilege, ensuring code execution under minimal necessary permissions. This weakness is critical in understanding and preventing unauthorized access or control within software systems, underscoring the importance of secure privilege allocation and access control mechanisms.

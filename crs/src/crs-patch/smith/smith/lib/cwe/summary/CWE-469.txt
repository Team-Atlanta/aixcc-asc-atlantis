CWE-469 refers to a security weakness characterized by the use of pointer subtraction to determine the size of a memory segment, which can lead to incorrect calculations if the involved pointers do not reside within the same memory chunk. Such an error falls under the base level of abstraction, indicating a problem that, while somewhat independent of specific resources or technologies, is described with enough detail to suggest methods for detection and prevention. This issue is closely related to incorrect calculation (CWE-682) and is considered a member of the pointer issues category (CWE-465). It typically arises during the implementation phase and is relevant to programming languages like C and C++ where pointer manipulation is common.

The consequences of exploiting this weakness can be severe, encompassing unauthorized memory modification, reading, or execution, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the vulnerable program. These impacts affect the core security attributes of access control, integrity, confidentiality, and availability. To mitigate this risk, developers are advised to use an index variable for navigation between pointers rather than subtracting them directly, ensuring all values are thoroughly validated. Detection methods with high effectiveness include fuzz testing, which generates unexpected inputs to uncover bugs, and automated static analysis, which examines source or compiled code for vulnerable patterns. This CWE entry, being at a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to vulnerabilities, plays an important role in understanding the root causes of certain types of software weaknesses, especially those involving faulty pointer use.

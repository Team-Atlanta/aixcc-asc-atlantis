CWE-168 addresses the improper handling of inconsistent special elements in software, where input handling does not properly manage an inconsistency among special characters or reserved words. This issue can occur in several ways, such as when paired characters are in the incorrect order or when special characters are not appropriately nested. The weakness is considered a base-level abstraction, meaning it has enough detail to suggest specific detection and prevention methods but is still quite independent of any particular technology or resource. It stands as a critical concern because it relates to both improper handling of syntactically invalid structure and improper use of special elements, pointing towards broader issues in data processing errors. Common consequences of exploiting this weakness include denial of service attacks (DoS), crashing, exiting, or restarting applications, bypassing protection mechanisms, and concealing other malicious activities. To mitigate this, developers are advised to utilize both denylists and allowlists to validate input, ensuring that only expected and appropriate inputs are processed. This involves assuming all input is potentially malicious, validating input strictly against a known set of acceptable criteria, and considering all relevant properties of the input, such as length, type, acceptable values, and adherence to business rules. Furthermore, inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before validation to prevent bypassing of validation mechanisms.

The CWE-22 bug involves improper limiting of a pathname to a restricted directory, also known as a 'Path Traversal'. This happens when the product doesn't properly neutralize special elements within the pathname. Attackers can use these special elements to escape out of the restricted location and access files or directories elsewhere on the system. The most common special element is "../", which is interpreted as the parent directory. This occurrence is termed as relative path traversal. Path traversal also includes absolute pathnames, referring to absolute path traversal. Usage of special elements or absolute pathnames could potentially allow an attacker to access, modify, or delete any file within the system. The bug highlights the importance of validating, transforming, and limiting inputs from external sources to prevent this weakness.

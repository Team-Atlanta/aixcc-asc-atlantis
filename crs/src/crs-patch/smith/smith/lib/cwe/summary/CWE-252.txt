CWE-252 focuses on the issue of unchecked return values from function or method calls in software, which might prevent the detection of unexpected states and conditions. This oversight occurs when developers make assumptions such as believing a function call cannot fail or thinking it doesn't matter if a function call fails. However, if an attacker can cause the function to fail or return an unexpected value, the software may operate under incorrect assumptions, leading to potential vulnerabilities. For instance, not verifying the success of a privilege drop can leave the program operating with higher privileges than intended. This weakness is broad and independent of specific languages or technologies, but detailed enough to identify specific methods for detection and prevention. It's linked to several other weaknesses and demonstrates the importance of checking all function returns to handle errors properly and maintain secure software operations.

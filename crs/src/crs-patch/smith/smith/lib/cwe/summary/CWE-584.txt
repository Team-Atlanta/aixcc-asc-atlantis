The CWE-584 defines a specific software weakness related to having a return statement inside a finally block, leading to potential unexpected behavior in a program. This issue can cause exceptions thrown in the try block to be discarded, altering the expected program execution flow. This weakness is abstract at a base level, meaning it provides enough detail for specific detection and prevention methods while being mostly independent of a particular resource or technology. It is identified as a child of the more generalized class of errors related to incorrect control flow scoping. Implementing a return statement in a finally block is discouraged as it can lead to the discarding of exceptions that should be handled or propagated. The recommended mitigation strategy is to avoid using return statements in finally blocks and reserve such blocks for cleanup code only. Accurate detection of this issue can be achieved through automated static analysis tools, which are highly effective in identifying patterns that could lead to this weakness by analyzing source code without execution. This CWE entry is essential for software developers, security researchers, and tool developers aiming to ensure secure coding practices and prevent software vulnerabilities related to control flow management.

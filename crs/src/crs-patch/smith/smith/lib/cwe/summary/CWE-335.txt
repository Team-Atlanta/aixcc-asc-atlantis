CWE-335 addresses the incorrect usage of seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs), a foundational vulnerability that could lead to significant security issues if left unaddressed. PRNGs are deterministic by design, meaning their output, while seemingly random, is actually predictable and repeats after a certain period. The security and unpredictability of a PRNG heavily rely on the proper selection and management of its seed value, which serves as the initial input for the generation process. A cryptographically secure and unique seed ensures the PRNG operates securely, making the seed's protection akin to that of cryptographic keys. Key concerns include the necessity of using a uniquely generated, cryptographically secure seed, and the importance of safeguarding the seed to prevent predictability of the PRNG's output. When seeds are not properly managed—such as being easily guessable or reused across different instances—it opens the door to potential attacks where adversaries could predict the PRNG's output, leading to vulnerabilities in systems relying on these supposedly random values for security functions like encryption keys, session IDs, or authorization tokens.

The vulnerability often stems from implementation phases where developers might overlook the importance of seed management, leading to the usage of predictable seeds like the current system time, or static seeds that remain constant across sessions. This issue is not bound to any specific programming language and can have widespread consequences, including the bypass of protection mechanisms and unauthorized system access. Examples of misuse include initializing PRNGs with constant seeds, using predictable values such as system time, or relying on insufficiently random input data for seed generation. This weakness has been referenced in various observed vulnerabilities across different platforms and products, highlighting its relevance and potential for causing real-world security incidents. Understanding and mitigating CWE-335 involves ensuring seed uniqueness, unpredictability, and secure management to maintain the integrity and security of applications relying on PRNGs for crucial operations.

CWE-294 addresses the security vulnerability known as "Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay." This weakness occurs in systems where attackers can intercept network traffic and use the captured data to bypass authentication mechanisms without the need for valid credentials. By replaying or slightly modifying the intercepted messages and sending them to the server, attackers can achieve unauthorized access. This type of attack exploits vulnerabilities in the design of a product that does not adequately prevent or detect the reuse of valid data transmissions. To mitigate this issue, architectures should implement mechanisms that use sequence or timestamps along with cryptographic checksums to ensure that each message is unique and cannot be reused by an attacker. Additionally, signing messages with cryptographic methods is crucial to prevent attackers from modifying message content and sequence numbers to bypass security controls. This vulnerability underscores the importance of designing systems with robust authentication and transmission security mechanisms to defend against capture-replay attacks.

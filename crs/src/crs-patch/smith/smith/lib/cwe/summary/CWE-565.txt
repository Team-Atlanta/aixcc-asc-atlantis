CWE-565 addresses the vulnerability arising from a product's reliance on cookies for security-critical operations without proper validation and integrity checking of those cookies. This vulnerability is classified as a Base level weakness, indicating it provides specific information sufficient for detection and prevention while remaining mostly independent of a particular resource or technology. It can manifest through various technologies and can have broad implications, such as bypassing authentication mechanisms, and enabling attackers to carry out injection attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS), or manipulating inputs in ways not anticipated by the application. The weakness is linked to broader classes of vulnerabilities related to client-side enforcement of server-side security and the external control of critical state data. Mitigations involve avoiding the use of cookie data for security decisions where possible, implementing robust server-side validation of cookie data, adding integrity checks to detect tampering, and protecting critical cookies from replay attacks through measures such as enforcing timeouts and including unpredictable server-side values in integrity checks. Automated static analysis tools can be effective in detecting this weakness by analyzing code for patterns that might not correctly validate or check the integrity of cookie data.

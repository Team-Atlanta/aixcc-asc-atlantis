CWE-1084 identifies a software design vulnerability where a function or method excessively uses operations that access or interact with data managers or file resources. This overutilization complicates the maintenance of the product, indirectly impacting its security. This complexity can make it challenging to identify and rectify vulnerabilities promptly and may also lead to the inadvertent introduction of new vulnerabilities. The Common Weakness Enumeration project recommends a limit, suggesting a default maximum of seven operations for the same data manager or file to mitigate this issue. This vulnerability is categorized under the broader issues relating to asymmetric resource consumption (amplification), falling within bad coding practices. Its primary consequence is a reduction in maintainability, which could indirectly facilitate the introduction of security vulnerabilities or complicate their detection. The nature of this weakness is more aligned with quality concerns, with an emphasis on maintainability rather than direct security implications. It's advised not to use CWE-1084 directly for mapping real-world vulnerabilities due to its indirect security implications.

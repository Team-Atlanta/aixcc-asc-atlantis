CWE-263: Password Aging with Long Expiration involves the support of password aging policies with overly extended expiration periods, making it less effective in enhancing security. Password aging is intended to mandate users to update their passwords after a specific duration, such as 30 or 90 days. However, when the expiration period is set too long, it provides attackers ample time to crack the passwords before they are refreshed. While password aging was previously regarded as a crucial security measure, its effectiveness has been questioned in recent times. Modern security threats and the advent of stronger security mechanisms, like slow hashes, have reduced its relevance. Furthermore, the enforcement of frequent password updates can lead to the adoption of weaker passwords by users. Despite its declining utility, password aging is still practiced in certain contexts owing to compliance requirements, for instance, with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Effective mitigation involves setting reasonable maximum password ages to balance security and user convenience, notifying users about upcoming expirations, and implementing measures to prevent password reuse or the creation of similar passwords.

CWE-413: Improper Resource Locking concerns a base-level weakness where a software product fails to appropriately lock a resource when exclusive access is required. This mismanagement in locking can permit attackers to alter the resource while it's in use by the software, contradicting the software's expectation that the resource remains unmodified during operation, potentially leading to a variety of unexpected behaviors. This issue is not language-specific and can manifest in any phase of software development, including architecture and design or implementation. The consequences of exploiting this weakness range from data integrity issues to denial of service, including crashes and instability. Effective mitigations include implementing correct synchronization mechanisms during the architecture and design phase and ensuring proper lock handling in implementation. Demonstrative examples in C and Java provide practical insights into both vulnerable and secure practices related to resource locking. Automated static analysis tools can offer high effectiveness in detecting instances of CWE-413 by analyzing source or compiled code for patterns indicative of improper resource locking.

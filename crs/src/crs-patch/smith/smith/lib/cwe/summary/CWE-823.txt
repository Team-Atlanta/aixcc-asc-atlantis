CWE-823 describes a vulnerability that occurs when a program performs pointer arithmetic using a valid pointer but employs an offset that potentially points outside of the memory's intended valid range. This kind of programming error can arise when offsets are derived from untrusted sources, result from incorrect calculations, or due to other programming mistakes. The consequences of using an out-of-range pointer offset include the possibility for attackers to read or write to memory locations that should be inaccessible to them. Such unauthorized access could lead to the manipulation of program variables, crashes, unstable behavior, and, in some cases, the execution of malicious code. This vulnerability is recognized as a base-level weakness since it provides enough detail for specific detection and prevention methods while being somewhat independent of the underpinning technology or resource involved. It belongs to a broader class of weaknesses that handle the improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer and is relevant for researchers, tool developers, and security analysts concerned with the practical implications of such vulnerabilities.

CWE-262 identifies a security flaw pertaining to the lack of password aging mechanisms in a system. Password aging, also known as password rotation, is a security policy that compels users to change their passwords within certain time intervals - typically every 30, 60, or 90 days. Its primary goal is to mitigate the risks associated with long-standing passwords, which become increasingly vulnerable over time. While this practice was once heralded as a critical security measure, its effectiveness has been questioned in recent years. Critics argue that password aging may not be as beneficial against contemporary cyber threats and can lead users to choose weaker, easily remembered passwords due to the frequent change requirements. Additionally, the imposition of regular password updates can lead to security fatigue among users and potentially reduce the effectiveness of secure password practices. Despite these criticisms, password aging policies remain in use, often driven by compliance needs with various security standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). However, the growing consensus suggests a reevaluation of password aging policies, emphasizing alternative security measures like the use of slow hash functions over forcing regular password changes.

Mitigation strategies for the lack of password aging include incorporating password change requirements into the system's design phase, thereby ensuring users are prompted to regularly update their authentication credentials. However, such measures should be balanced with user experience considerations to prevent the adoption of less secure passwords. The debate over password aging underscores a broader discussion on effective password management practices in the face of evolving cyber threats.

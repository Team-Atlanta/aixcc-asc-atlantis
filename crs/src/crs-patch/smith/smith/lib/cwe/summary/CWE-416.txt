CWE-416, also known as a Use-After-Free vulnerability, refers to a situation where memory is accessed after it has been freed. This can lead to various adverse effects, from corrupting legitimate data to executing arbitrary code. The issue primarily stems from inadequate management of memory - often when confusion arises over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memory, or during error conditions. Use-after-free errors could potentially corrupt valid data, crash a program, or even allow unauthorized code execution if a malicious user exploits this bug. Protective measures include choosing a language that offers automatic memory management or ensuring freed pointers are set to NULL immediately after being freed.

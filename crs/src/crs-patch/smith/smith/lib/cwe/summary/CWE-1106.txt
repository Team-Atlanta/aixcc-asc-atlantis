CWE-1106 identifies a weakness related to the insufficient use of symbolic constants in software development. This issue arises when the source code relies on literal constants that might need to evolve or change over time, instead of utilizing symbolic constants that can make updates easier and code more understandable. The core problem with this approach is that it significantly hampers the maintainability of the product. This maintenance challenge indirectly affects security, mainly because it can become harder and more time-consuming to locate and address vulnerabilities, potentially easing the introduction of new vulnerabilities. Although classified under CWE as a base weakness that spans across behaviors, properties, technology, language, and resources, it is primarily seen as a quality issue with indirect security implications. Additionally, it's noted that this particular CWE entry should not be mapped directly to real-world vulnerabilities as it primarily addresses quality concerns rather than direct security implications.

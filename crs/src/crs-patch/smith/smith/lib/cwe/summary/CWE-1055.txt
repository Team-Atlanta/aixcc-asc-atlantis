CWE-1055 addresses the complication arising from the use of multiple inheritance from concrete classes in software products. This architectural weakness makes product maintenance more challenging, indirectly affecting security. The difficulty stems from it being more taxing or time-consuming to identify and rectify vulnerabilities, potentially facilitating the inadvertent introduction of further vulnerabilities. Specifically, CWE-1055 is conceptualized as a base-level abstraction weakness, characterized by its broad applicability across different dimensions such as behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. Despite being recognized primarily as a quality concern rather than a direct security threat, the weakness's categorization under several quality and maintainability measures emphasizes its significance in the realm of software development practices. It is explicitly advised against using CWE-1055 for mapping real-world vulnerabilities due to its nature as a quality issue with no direct security implications. This guidance aligns with the overall objective to enhance the maintainability and security of software systems by acknowledging and addressing complexities related to multiple inheritance from concrete classes.

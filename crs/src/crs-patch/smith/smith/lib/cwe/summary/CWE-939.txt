CWE-939 pertains to the improper authorization in the handling of custom URL schemes within software applications, particularly on mobile platforms. This weakness arises when the application integrates a custom URL scheme for inter-application communication, such as on iOS devices, where it's a sole method for such interactions, and fails to adequately restrict access to the handlers that process these custom URL schemes. Without proper authorization checks, malicious actors can invoke these handlers, leading to potential security vulnerabilities including unauthorized data modification or access. It is critical for developers to implement stringent checks and validate the sources invoking the custom URL schemes to prevent exploitation. This could involve using user confirmation dialogs for actions that could impact data integrity or privacy, or implementing a whitelist of applications that are allowed to use these custom URL schemes, thereby enhancing the security posture of the application against such threats.

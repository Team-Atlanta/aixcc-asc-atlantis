CWE-353 addresses a critical security issue where a transmission protocol utilized by a product lacks a mechanism for integrity verification, such as checksums, during data transmission. This absence of integrity checks exposes a system to risks of data corruption without detection, undermining the reliability and security of the transmitted data. Integrity checks, or checksums, serve as the initial, application-level verification that can confirm data has not been altered or corrupted in transit. The importance of implementing these checks stems from the end-to-end principle, suggesting that integrity validations should be conducted at the earliest feasible layer in the transmission process. This baseline level of integrity verification is crucial since it encompasses entire messages, offering a more comprehensive safeguard than could be achieved at earlier stages focusing only on individual packets. Inadequate integrity verification mechanisms open avenues for security breaches, allowing attackers to tamper with or corrupt transmitted data undetectably, significantly impacting the system's integrity and non-repudiation properties. Effective mitigation strategies include incorporating appropriate checksum functionalities during the architecture and design phase, and ensuring accurate implementation in subsequent stages to safeguard data integrity throughout the transmission process.

CWE-323 addresses the security weakness of reusing a nonce (number used once) along with a key pair in encryption processes. Nonces are critical in encryption systems as they ensure that each session or message has a unique identifier or value, preventing replay attacks where an attacker could reuse valid data transmission to masquerade as a legitimate user. When nonces are reused, it undermines the security of the encryption by allowing potential impersonation or replay attacks. This weakness is particularly prevalent in the context of encrypted communication, where nonces, often combined with keys to generate new session keys, assure the uniqueness and thereby the integrity and security of each message exchange. However, a failure in implementing unique nonces can lead to serious security vulnerabilities including the bypassing of protection mechanisms and assuming false identities, which can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of communications. Mitigation strategies involve refusing to reuse nonce values and employing techniques like incrementing, time-based, or challenge-response mechanisms to assure nonce uniqueness. Detected across various platforms and languages, the exploitation of this weakness has a high likelihood, emphasizing the need for careful design and implementation practices in cryptography to prevent such vulnerabilities.

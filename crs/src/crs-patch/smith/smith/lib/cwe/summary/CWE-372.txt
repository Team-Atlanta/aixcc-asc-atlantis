CWE-372, identified as "Incomplete Internal State Distinction," is a base-level weakness where a software product fails to accurately identify its current state, mistakenly assuming it's in one state (X) when it is actually in another state (Y). This misidentification leads the system to execute operations that are incorrect in a security-relevant context. It's primarily tied to the product's misperception of its own operational state and could manifest due to several factors, including handling errors inaccurately, failing to manage out-of-order processes, or misinterpreting multiple signals or commands. This category of weakness often results from, or is closely linked to, other underlying vulnerabilities, such as uncontrolled resource handling or errors in verifying the status or correctness of operations. Though currently discouraged for mapping to real-world vulnerabilities due to potential deprecation and overlap with other CWE entries, CWE-372 highlights critical aspects that contribute to insecure software states, implicating errors in state management and control flow as primary concerns. The weakness does not tie to any specific programming language, indicating its relevance across various software development contexts.

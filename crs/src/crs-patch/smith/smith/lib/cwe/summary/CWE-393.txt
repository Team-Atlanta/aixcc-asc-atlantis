CWE-393 concerns a software flaw where functions or operations return incorrect values or status codes that misleadingly do not signify an error. This discrepancy can cause the software to adjust its behavior based on the erroneous result. The danger of such a flaw is amplified when these functions are employed to make security-critical decisions or relay security-critical information, leading to a false sense of safety regarding actions or operations that might actually be risky or unsecured. This issue arises at a base level of abstraction, meaning it maintains a degree of independence from specific resources or technologies, yet provides enough detail to suggest strategies for detection and prevention. The most direct consequences include the possibility of the system entering an unexpected state or executing unintended logic, which could have various negative ramifications depending on the context. Example cases include incorrect handling of exceptional conditions or provisioning of specified functionality. Detection methods like fuzz testing, which involves generating a wide range of inputs to dynamically test the code, are considered highly effective for identifying instances of CWE-393. This weakness signifies a fundamental error in coding practices that can lead to severe vulnerabilities if not properly addressed.

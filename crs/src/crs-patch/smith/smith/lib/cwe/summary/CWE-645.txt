CWE-645 describes a vulnerability related to overly restrictive account lockout mechanisms within systems or applications. This type of security mechanism is commonly implemented to protect against brute force attacks by locking out user accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts. The intention behind this approach is to hinder unauthorized access attempts. However, if the lockout policy is too stringent, it might allow attackers to deliberately trigger these lockouts, leading to denial of service for legitimate users. This can result in users being unable to access their accounts either for a specified duration or until an administrator intervenes to unlock the account. It's crucial for the design of the account lockout feature to strike a balance in its restrictiveness to prevent both unauthorized access and unintended service disruptions to legitimate users.

Mitigation strategies include the development of intelligent password throttling mechanisms that consider factors like the user's IP address, employing progressively increasing lockout timeouts following consecutive failed login attempts, and exploring alternative measures to account lockout for deterring brute force attacks. Examples of such alternatives may involve challenging the user or the user's device to solve a computational puzzle, which could deter automated attack methods without significantly impacting user experience. This security weakness highlights the importance of carefully designing security features that are robust enough to protect against attacks while minimizing negative impacts on legitimate users.

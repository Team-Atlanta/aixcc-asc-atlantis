CWE-331 addresses the issue of insufficient entropy in systems, a situation where an algorithm or scheme fails to produce a high enough level of randomness. This deficiency in randomness results in the generation of patterns or clusters of values that occur more frequently than others, undermining the security by making certain outcomes more predictable. Insufficient entropy primarily affects mechanisms that rely on randomness for security functions, such as cryptographic operations, authentication processes, and the generation of session identifiers. When the entropy is low, attackers can more easily predict the values generated, potentially leading to unauthorized access or the circumvention of security measures designed to protect systems and data.

This weakness is categorized under the base level of abstraction, indicating it encompasses issues that, despite being somewhat independent of specific technologies or resources, provide enough detail to guide the identification of similar vulnerabilities across various contexts. Relationships with other CWEs highlight that insufficient entropy is a parent of issues related to pseudorandom and true random number generators' entropy problems. The consequences of this weakness can be severe, enabling attackers to bypass protection mechanisms or compromise the integrity and confidentiality of data. Mitigation involves ensuring that algorithms and systems generate sufficient randomness to meet the security requirements of the application, which might include using cryptographic-grade random number generators or incorporating more sources of entropy.

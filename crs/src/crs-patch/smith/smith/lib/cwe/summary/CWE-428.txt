CWE-428 concerns a security weakness wherein a product uses a search path that includes an unquoted element, which contains whitespace or other separators. This configuration error can lead to the product accessing resources in a parent directory inadvertently. The vulnerability stems from the fact that, if a malicious individual can interact with the file system, they could exploit this weakness to elevate their privileges. This could be achieved by creating a misleading file (e.g., "C:\Program.exe") that gets executed by a privileged program, potentially causing unauthorized actions to be performed by leveraging functions like WinExec in Windows environments. This issue is classified as a base-level weakness, indicating it provides enough detail to identify specific detection and prevention methods without being tied to a resource or technology too narrowly. It has relationships with other weaknesses, such as exposure of resources to the wrong sphere (CWE-668) and is linked to broader categories addressing path traversal and file handling issues.

Mitigation strategies focus on implementation practices, emphasizing the need for properly quoting full search paths before executing a program. This includes adopting an input validation strategy that assumes all input is potentially malicious, allowing only known good inputs that strictly conform to specifications, and avoiding double decoding inputs to prevent bypassing validation mechanisms. This issue is not restricted to any single programming language and is more prevalent in operating systems like Windows NT, due to their support for spaces in filenames, though it can occur in any OS that allows spaces in file or directory names.

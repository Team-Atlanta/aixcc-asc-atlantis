CWE-605 concerns a security vulnerability whereby multiple sockets are allowed to bind to the same port, creating potential security issues such as service spoofing and packet theft. In detail, systems that enable the reuse of socket addresses (`SO_REUSEADDR`) combined with a call to `bind()` can allow a process to bind to a port already bound by another process using `INADDR_ANY`. This issue makes it possible for an attacker to hijack specific server-bound addresses to intercept UDP packets or take over TCP connections originally intended for other services. The vulnerability is classified at a variant level of abstraction, indicating it is specific to certain technologies or languages. It emerges primarily during the implementation and operation phases of development and is noted for its impact on system confidentiality and integrity by potentially allowing unauthorized access to application data and facilitating the spoofing of network services. Mitigations center around policy modifications such as restricting server socket addresses to known local addresses.

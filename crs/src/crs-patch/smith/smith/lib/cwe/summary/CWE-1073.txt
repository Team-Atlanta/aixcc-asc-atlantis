CWE-1073 describes a software weakness where a client function or method sends a large number of data accesses or queries through a data manager, bypassing more efficient database capabilities. This inefficiency can degrade the product's performance and, if exploitable by an attacker, may pose a vulnerability. The benchmark for what constitutes a "large number of data accesses/queries" is subjective, but CISQ suggests a default maximum of two data accesses per function or method as a guideline. This kind of weakness is categorized under various broader concerns, including bad coding practices, performance efficiency in CISQ quality measures, and resource lifecycle management. It is important to note that CWE-1073 is primarily considered a quality issue rather than a direct security vulnerability, indicating its role in potentially facilitating the introduction of more directly security-relevant weaknesses. This entry serves as a base-level weakness incorporating behaviors, properties, technologies, languages, and resources, aimed at a wide audience interested in the conceptual, operational, and mapping aspects of software weaknesses.

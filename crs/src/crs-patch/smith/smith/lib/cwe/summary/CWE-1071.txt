CWE-1071 identifies a weakness where a code block in a program is left empty. This issue can occur in various parts of the code, including within function definitions, conditionals, and exception handlers. An empty code block may sometimes be intentional, but it can also indicate a range of problems such as unfinished code, accidental deletion of code, or unexpected results due to macro expansion. Even though the syntax of some programming languages allows for these empty blocks, they can lead to errors if they contravene established conventions or application programming interfaces (APIs). This weakness is categorized under base level abstraction, meaning it provides enough detail for specific detection and prevention methods across different dimensions like behavior, property, and technology. Examples provided demonstrate the potential reliability issues stemming from unhandled exceptions, such as failing to log an arithmetic error or to properly synchronize access to data in a multi-threaded environment. By not addressing these empty blocks, the reliability of the software can be reduced, posing indirect security risks by potentially facilitating the introduction of more severe vulnerabilities or making them harder to detect.

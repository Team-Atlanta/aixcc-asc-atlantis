CWE-1094 details a performance-related software weakness where an application conducts an index range scan over a significant portion of a large data table, potentially encompassing a vast number of rows. This process can severely degrade the product's performance. If an adversary can access and exploit the relevant portions of code, this efficiency issue may escalate into a security vulnerability. Although definitions of what constitutes a "large data table" or an "excessive index range" can differ across products and development contexts, it is generally advised to regard a table exceeding one million rows and an index range over ten as indicative of this problem. This weakness falls under foundational issues that might not directly compromise security but can indirectly facilitate more serious security-related weaknesses by making them harder to detect or easier to introduce. It is categorized under several high-level concepts including asymmetric resource consumption (amplification), bad coding practices, and is part of various quality and performance efficiency measures according to CISQ's 2016 guidelines. Importantly, CWE-1094 should not be used for mapping real-world vulnerabilities due to its primary classification as a quality issue with indirect security implications.

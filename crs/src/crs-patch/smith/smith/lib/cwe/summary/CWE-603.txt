CWE-603, identified as "Use of Client-Side Authentication," describes a security weakness where authentication processes are executed on the client side of a client/server product without corresponding server-side validation. This situation permits the bypassing of authentication mechanisms through the use of modified clients that omit authentication checks. The inherent frailty of client-side authentication lies in its susceptibility to reverse engineering, enabling attackers to circumvent authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to protected application areas. Moreover, related weaknesses and categories, such as "Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security" (CWE-602) and "Weak Authentication" (CWE-1390), highlight the broader implications for security architectures, emphasizing the necessity for robust server-side authentication practices.

The vulnerability outlined under CWE-603 has consequential implications, notably the potential for adversaries to bypass protection mechanisms and gain privileges or assume identities, as illustrated in real-world examples like CVE-2022-33139. Mitigation strategies primarily focus on the architecture and design phases, advising against reliance on client-side data for security decisions and emphasizing the critical need for server-side authentication procedures. Such measures are essential for preventing this class of vulnerability, which is applicable across various languages and technologies, including ICS/OT environments, demonstrating its wide relevance and the importance of comprehensive security practices in the design and implementation of client/server systems.

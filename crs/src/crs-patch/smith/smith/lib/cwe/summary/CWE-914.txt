CWE-914 pertains to the improper control of dynamically-identified variables, a base-level weakness that emerges when a product inadequately restricts access to variables identified dynamically, based on input strings. This vulnerability is significant as it can allow attackers to modify or manipulate variables that were not intended to be accessible, leading to unauthorized data modification, execution of commands, or other impacts that alter the program's intended execution flow. Dynamic variable identification features, while beneficial for development flexibility and efficiency, pose security risks if attackers can influence variables with security implications. This weakness, if exploited, enables attackers to alter sensitive data, execute unauthorized commands, or change the program's execution logic, based on the specifics of the implementation and the environment in which it operates. Mitigation strategies include input validation to ensure only an allowlist of variables can be modified and refactoring code to avoid the need for dynamically identifying internal program variables.

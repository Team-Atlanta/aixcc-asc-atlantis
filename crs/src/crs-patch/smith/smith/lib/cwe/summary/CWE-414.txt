CWE-414 addresses a critical weakness where a software product neglects to verify the presence of a lock before executing sensitive operations on a resource. This failure can lead to several adverse outcomes, notably in terms of integrity and availability, including unauthorized modification of application data, as well as causing the application to crash, exit abruptly, or become unstableâ€”opening doors to various exploitation scenarios by attackers. This weakness, classified under the Base level for its sufficient detail to suggest specific detection and prevention methods while remaining somewhat independent of technology or resource specifics, is a direct descendant of more generalized issues related to improper locking (CWE-667). It is recognized across multiple programming languages and is not specific to any single language, highlighting its broad relevance and potential for widespread impact.

Effective mitigation strategies involve implementing a reliable lock mechanism during the architecture, design, and implementation phases to prevent unauthorized access or modifications. The underpinning importance of such a practice is underscored by real-world vulnerabilities that have been observed, for example, where products did not properly ensure that a lock was in place, thus allowing attackers to access functionalities undesirably. This CWE is part of several critical categories and is referenced by additional CWE entries related to concurrency and missing lock issues, signifying its significance in the broader context of software and hardware weaknesses.

CWE-224: Obscured Security-relevant Information by Alternate Name covers a software vulnerability where an application records security-relevant data using an alternate name rather than the canonical or expected name of the affected entity. This base level weakness, applicable across various languages and not specific to any, concerns the mismanagement of how information is logged or tracked, potentially enabling activities to be hidden or identities to be assumed by malicious parties. Typically identified at the implementation phase of software development, but with implications during operation, CWE-224 is a direct child of a more abstract class concerning Information Loss or Omission (CWE-221). It affects non-repudiation and access control by allowing attackers to evade detection or gain unauthorized privileges through the manipulation of how data or actions are recorded by the system. A common real-world consequence of this weakness includes the ability of attackers to obfuscate their actions, as exemplified by accessing files through symbolic links without proper logging of the canonical file names, thus obscuring the files actually accessed. This weakness emphasizes the necessity for accurate and secure logging mechanisms to prevent privilege escalation or unauthorized access by ensuring that all security-related actions are attributed to the correct entity in a traceable, non-repudiable manner.

CWE-191 pertains to an Integer Underflow (or Wraparound) vulnerability, which occurs when one value is subtracted from another such that the result is lesser than the minimum allowed integer value, leading to an incorrect result. This vulnerability can manifest in both signed and unsigned integers, impacting a wide range of programming languages including C, C++, Java, and C#. The underflow can inadvertently cause negative numbers to become very large positive numbers when interpreted as unsigned, or lead to the minimum or maximum values when wrapped around in signed integers. These flawed calculations have various repercussions like crashes, performance degradation through CPU or memory consumption, data corruption, or even potentially allowing unauthorized code execution or bypassing security mechanisms. Such vulnerabilities typically emerge during the implementation phase due to incorrect calculations or inadequate validation of data, especially when influenced by external input. Automated Static Analysis tools have been effective in detecting such weaknesses by analyzing the code for patterns that might result in integer underflow without executing the code. This category of vulnerability is critical as it directly impacts the application's integrity, availability, and sometimes its confidentiality and access control mechanisms, marking it essential for developers and security analysts to understand and mitigate efficiently.

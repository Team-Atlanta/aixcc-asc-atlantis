CWE-1115 addresses the issue where source code elements lack a standardized prologue or header. This common weakness involves source files that do not consistently provide essential information at the beginning of the file, which is typically standardized across a project to include details such as the module name, version number, author, purpose, and various considerations like assumptions, limitations, and accuracy. The absence of such prologues hinders the ability to understand, maintain, and secure the code effectively. It contributes to difficulties in both comprehending the code accurately and quickly, and in maintaining the product due to reduced analyzability. This, in turn, can make it more challenging or time-consuming to identify and fix vulnerabilities, possibly leading to an increased risk of introducing further vulnerabilities. CWE-1115 is identified as a base-level weakness, focusing on quality issues that might indirectly facilitate the introduction of security-relevant weaknesses or make them harder to detect, rather than directly impacting security.

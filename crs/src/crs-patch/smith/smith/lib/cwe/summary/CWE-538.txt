CWE-538 addresses the security weakness where sensitive information is inserted into files or directories that are externally accessible, even to actors who should be permitted access to these files but not to the contained sensitive data. This issue belongs to the base level of abstraction, signifying a weakness that, while mostly independent of specific resources or technologies, offers sufficient detail to guide the identification and prevention of the threat across various dimensions such as behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. The vulnerability arises from the erroneous exposure of confidential data through files that are not adequately secured, leading to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. The weakness highlights several related security issues, including the insertion of sensitive information into log files, inclusion of sensitive data in source code, and exposure of service description files containing confidential information. Common consequences of this weakness include the unauthorized reading of files or directories, leading to a compromise of confidentiality. Mitigation strategies emphasize the importance of secure architecture and design to prevent the exposure of sensitive information, complemented by cautious operation and system configuration practices. Automated static analysis is considered highly effective in detecting instances of this vulnerability through thorough analysis of source code or compiled/binary code without execution, aiming to identify unsafe patterns of data flow that could lead to exploitation.

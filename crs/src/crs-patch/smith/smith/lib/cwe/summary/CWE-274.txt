CWE-274, titled "Improper Handling of Insufficient Privileges," is a vulnerability where a product does not adequately handle or incorrectly handles situations when it lacks the privileges necessary to perform an operation. This often leads to various security weaknesses. The weakness is categorized as a "Base" level in the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) structure, implying that while it is somewhat independent of specific technologies, it contains enough detail to guide the identification and prevention of the issue. Typically, these base-level weaknesses describe vulnerabilities across two or three dimensions, such as behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. This kind of weakness is especially relevant in areas such as software development, where it can lead to privilege issues, and architectural concepts, where proper authorization of actors is crucial. The CWE entry for this vulnerability includes relationships to similar or related weaknesses, modes of introduction (notably during the implementation phase or due to operational challenges), applicable platforms (highlighting that it's not specific to any language), common consequences (which may alter execution logic), and observed examples in real-world vulnerabilities. Automated static analysis is noted as a highly effective means for detecting instances of this weakness. However, due to potential deprecation and overlap with other CWE entries, particularly CWE-280 related to handling insufficient permissions or privileges, there's a suggestion that CWE-274 might be deprecated in future updates of the CWE list.

CWE-112 pertains to the vulnerability concerning missing XML validation, marked by the Weakness ID 112. This weakness arises when a product receives XML data from an unknown source yet fails to validate this data against the correct XML schema. The foundational issue with this practice is it assumes the XML document to be correctly structured without verification, creating potential vulnerabilities. By not validating against a Document Type Definition (DTD) or XML schema, developers inadvertently leave room for attackers to insert malicious, unexpected, or otherwise harmful data, leveraging the assumption of valid input to disrupt system functions. 

This vulnerability is categorized under Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input and is associated with data validation issues along with improper input validation â€“ making it a base-level weakness that spans behavior, property, technology, language, and resource dimensions. Effective mitigation involves the validation of XML inputs against a known XML Schema or DTD during the architecture and design phase, with automated static analysis identified as a highly effective detection method. This validation enforces structured document processing, thus preventing attackers from exploiting the system by ensuring only well-formed content is processed.

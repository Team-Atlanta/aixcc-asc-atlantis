CWE-756 is identified as a base-level weakness relating to the absence of custom error pages in software, which could potentially expose sensitive information to users. This weakness falls into a broader class of issues concerning improper handling of exceptional conditions (CWE-755) and manifests specifically when applications fail to define custom error handling mechanisms. Instead of providing generic error messages that conceal the underlying details, systems that lack custom error pages may inadvertently reveal snippets of sensitive data or details about the applicationâ€™s framework, database, or other components, thus aiding attackers in crafting targeted exploits. Effective management of this weakness typically involves configuring web applications to return custom error pages that minimize the amount of information disclosed about the internal workings of the application, thereby mitigating the risk of information exposure that could lead to further vulnerabilities being exploited. Examples provided illustrate bad practices, such as displaying default error messages with stack traces in Java and ASP.NET applications, and contrast them with secure configurations that either limit detailed error information to local users or utilize custom error pages to obfuscate sensitive details from unauthorized users. This CWE entry is also linked to several categories that underscore its relevance in various vulnerability contexts, including error handling and security misconfigurations, further emphasizing the importance of tailored error responses in maintaining application security.

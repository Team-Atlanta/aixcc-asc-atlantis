CWE-117, termed "Improper Output Neutralization for Logs," identifies a security vulnerability that arises when a software product does not correctly neutralize (sanitize) log output. This flaw creates an opportunity for attackers to forge log entries or inject malicious content into log files. The issue generally occurs when data from an untrusted source is incorporated into an application or system log without adequate validation or encoding. This can lead to various security risks, including the manipulation of log files to hide an attacker's activities, execute unauthorized commands, or even compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the system. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting input that, when logged, is processed as valid log entries, thereby enabling activities such as log forging or injection attacks.

To mitigate this issue, developers are advised to implement stringent input validation practices, ensuring all input is considered potentially malicious and treated accordingly. Specifically, an "accept known good" strategy, where only input that strictly conforms to predefined specifications is accepted, should be adopted. Additionally, appropriate output encoding should be specified to ensure that the receiving component correctly interprets the log output, minimizing the risk of injection attacks. Developers should also avoid double-decoding input and ensure that input is properly canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before validation. These steps, along with careful analysis during the implementation phase, can significantly reduce the likelihood and potential impact of exploitation.

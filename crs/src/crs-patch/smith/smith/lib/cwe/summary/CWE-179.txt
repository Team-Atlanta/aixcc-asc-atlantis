CWE-179, denoted as "Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Validation," describes a vulnerability that arises when a product validates input before applying protection mechanisms that modify the input. This premature validation could allow attackers to bypass the validation steps by providing dangerous inputs that emerge only after the modification process, such as canonicalization or cleansing. Essentially, if input validation occurs too early—before the input has been transformed into its canonical or 'safe' form—attackers can exploit this oversight by manipulating inputs in a way that the initial validation fails to catch but later processing steps render harmful. For instance, an input that looks benign before cleansing might turn into a dangerous command or query after transformation. This base-level weakness is broadly applicable across software and hardware systems, manifesting in varied forms like injection attacks or arbitrary code execution due to the bypassing of protection mechanisms.

Demonstrative examples include the mishandling of directory paths, where validation checks are circumvented through directory traversal sequences that are only recognized as such after transformations are applied. Mitigation strategies focus on performing input validation after the input has been decoded and canonicalized to the internal representations expected by the application, ensuring that validation accurately reflects the data as it will be used. This approach prevents attackers from introducing harmful inputs post-validation and emphasizes the correct sequencing of validation relative to input processing steps to enhance security.

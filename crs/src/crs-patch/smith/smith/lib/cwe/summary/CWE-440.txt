CWE-440, labeled as "Expected Behavior Violation," identifies a vulnerability resulting from the failure of a feature, API, or function to perform according to its specification. This base-level weakness, which can be independent of a specific resource or technology, provides enough detail to pinpoint specific detection and prevention methods. These weaknesses usually involve a combination of behavior, property, technology, language, and resources. As part of the CWE classification, CWE-440 falls under broader categories related to incorrect provision of specified functionality and behavioral problems across software development and hardware design contexts. The presence of this vulnerability can pave the way for attackers to manipulate or compromise system functionalities leading to various security implications, such as quality degradation or other context-specific technical impacts.

Illustrated through demonstrative examples, a notable vulnerability concerns the misimplementation within the Hack@DAC'21 OpenPiton System-on-Chip's Control and Status Register module, particularly the update logic for the sie (supervisor interrupt enable) register in compliance with the RISC-V specification. The flaw allows for undesirable manipulation of the sie register through inappropriate influence from the user-accessible utval (user trap value) register. This misstep permits potential adversarial control over supervisor-level interrupts, posing risks including privilege escalation and denial of service attacks. Corrective action entails omitting the utval influence in the mie_d register's update logic to align with proper RISC-V protocol. This case underscores the critical importance of adhering to specification expectations to prevent security vulnerabilities.

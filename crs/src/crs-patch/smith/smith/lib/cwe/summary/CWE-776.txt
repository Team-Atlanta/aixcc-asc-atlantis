CWE-776 addresses the vulnerability arising from improper restriction of recursive entity references within DTDs (Document Type Definitions) when using XML documents. This vulnerability, identifiable under the Weakness ID 776, operates at a base level of abstraction, implying that it can provide specific detection and prevention methods across various technological resources. It is also referred to by alternate terms such as XEE (XML Entity Expansion) and "Billion Laughs Attack," highlighting its potential for causing denial-of-service by triggering explosive growth of parsed data. This growth results from an excessive number of nested or recursive entity definitions in a DTD. The primary danger of this vulnerability lies in its ability to allow attackers to exponentially expand data through recursive references, rapidly exhausting system resources and potentially leading to a denial of service. Demonstrative examples in documentation illustrate how an XML bomb can be created with a few lines of XML code, showcasing the potential for 4GB of data expansion from a single entity expansion process. Potential mitigations suggest prohibiting the use of DTDs or utilizing XML parsers that limit recursive entity expansion. Automated static analysis is touted as an effective detection method, highlighting the importance of preemptive scans for recursive entity declarations in XML files. This CWE entry is crucial for understanding and mitigating risks associated with XML entity expansion vulnerabilities, providing a foundation for safer XML document processing and handling.

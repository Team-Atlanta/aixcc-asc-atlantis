CWE-1117 refers to a scenario where a function or method is callable but lacks a comprehensive behavioral summary. This means that the signature and/or associated inline documentation fails to adequately describe the callable's inputs, outputs, side effects, assumptions, or return codes. The absence of a detailed description complicates the maintenance of the product as it hinders the efficiency and accuracy in identifying and rectifying vulnerabilities, potentially making the system more prone to introducing security flaws. This weakness, classified under Base level abstraction, is more about the quality of documentation rather than a direct security vulnerability. However, its indirect consequences on security stem from the increased difficulty in maintaining and securing the code. The CWE entry illustrates this as primarily a quality issue with no direct security implications but acknowledges that poor documentation can indirectly facilitate the introduction of security-relevant weaknesses or complicate their detection. Additionally, it’s noted that CWE-1117 should not be used to map real-world vulnerabilities because it’s conceptualized as a quality issue rather than a direct security threat.

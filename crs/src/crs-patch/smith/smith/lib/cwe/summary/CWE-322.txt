CWE-322, concerning "Key Exchange without Entity Authentication," addresses a critical vulnerability that arises when a system exchanges keys with an actor without verifying the actor's identity. This lack of authentication can compromise the security of the information exchange, leaving it vulnerable to impersonation attacks. Despite the exchangeâ€™s capacity to maintain the integrity of the transmitted data, it fails to ensure the legitimacy of the communicating entities. This vulnerability primarily enables attackers to assume the identity of a legitimate server or user, manipulate traffic, and potentially access sensitive information or systems by using stolen credentials. The threat is not limited to any specific programming language or technology, underscoring the importance of incorporating authentication mechanisms in the system design and implementation stages to mitigate potential exploits. High exploit likelihood is noted, with significant consequences including bypassing protection mechanisms and unauthorized access to confidential data. Mitigation strategies involve ensuring proper authentication during the architecture and design phase and implementing checks to confirm the identity of entities in encrypted communications. This vulnerability is recognized across various security discussions, including the OWASP Top Ten 2021 Category for Cryptographic Failures, and necessitates careful consideration in the design and deployment of secure systems.

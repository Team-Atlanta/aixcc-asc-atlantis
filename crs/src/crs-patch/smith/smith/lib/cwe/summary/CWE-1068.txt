CWE-1068 describes an inconsistency between a product's implemented functionality and its documented design, ranking as a base-level weakness that is broadly applicable independent of a specific resource or technology. This incoherence makes maintaining the product more challenging, as the deviations can complicate or prolong the process of identifying and fixing vulnerabilities, potentially increasing the risk of introducing security flaws. This weakness is a manifestation of poor adherence to coding standards (ChildOf CWE-710) and is categorized under documentation issues (MemberOf CWE-1225) and poor coding practices (MemberOf CWE-1412). It is particularly significant in the implementation phase and affects not only general technology but also Industrial Control Systems/Operational Technology (ICS/OT) to an undetermined extent. Due to its nature as primarily a quality issue without direct security implications, this CWE ID is not intended for mapping real-world vulnerabilities but highlights the indirect security risks associated with documentation and implementation discrepancies.

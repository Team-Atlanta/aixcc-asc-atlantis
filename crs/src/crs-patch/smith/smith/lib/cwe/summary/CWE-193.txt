CWE-193, known as an Off-by-one Error, pertains to a category of software vulnerabilities where a product calculates or uses an incorrect value that is either one more or one less than the intended correct value. This miscalculation can lead to various security issues such as buffer overflows, memory corruption, or denial of service attacks due to the mishandling of data size parameters. The essence of this weakness lies in the insufficient allocation of resources (like memory space) to accommodate intended operations, specifically where boundary values are misjudged by a single unit. This might occur during operations that involve managing arrays, strings, or other data structures where accurate sizing is critical to preventing overflow or underflow conditions. Real-world manifestations of CWE-193 typically result in undefined behavior that could either crash the system, lead to data corruption, or even allow attackers to execute arbitrary code. The risk is further accentuated when handling inputs or data from untrusted sources, which could exploit these off-by-one errors to compromise system integrity or availability. Effective mitigation involves careful consideration of boundary conditions and ensuring accurate allocation of resources, especially when manipulating memory structures. Detection methods such as automated static analysis can prove highly effective in identifying instances where off-by-one errors might occur.

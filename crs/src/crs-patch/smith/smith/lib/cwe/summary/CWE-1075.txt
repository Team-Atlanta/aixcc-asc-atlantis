CWE-1075 identifies a vulnerability tied to the practice of performing unconditional control flow transfers, like "goto" statements, outside recognized branching structures such as switch blocks. This programming flaw complicates maintenance efforts because it indirectly influences the security posture by making it harder and more time-consuming to identify and patch vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it may inadvertently lower the barrier for introducing additional vulnerabilities. This weakness is categorized as a base level issue, indicating it has sufficient detail to inform specific detection and prevention methods across various dimensions including behavior, property, technology, language, and resource. It is acknowledged for its ability to reduce maintainability, thus increasing the likelihood of indirect security challenges by potentially easing the insertion of security-relevant weaknesses or complicating their detection. Additionally, this vulnerability is tied to excessive code complexity and has been mapped in various taxonomies and frameworks emphasizing quality and maintainability in software development.

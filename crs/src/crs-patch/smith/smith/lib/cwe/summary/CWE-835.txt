The CWE-835 vulnerability, "Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')", denotes a software bug where a loop (a fundamental programming construct that repeats a block of code) is implemented with an exit condition that can never be met, resulting in an infinite loop. This loop without a reachable endpoint can significantly impact an application by consuming excessive computational resources, such as CPU time or memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) scenario where the application becomes unresponsive or severely degraded. This base-level weakness is not specific to any programming language, indicating that it can arise in various software development contexts. The vulnerability becomes particularly exploitable if an attacker can influence the conditions leading to the infinite loop, thus making it a security concern that can be utilized to perform DoS attacks. Examples provided illustrate scenarios in which poor loop handling and failure to validate input parameters can lead to infinite looping conditions. CVE references indicate real-world instances where this weakness was exploited, showcasing its practical relevance and the necessity for developers to appropriately handle loop conditions to prevent such vulnerabilities.

CWE-134, known as Use of Externally-Controlled Format String, refers to a vulnerability arising from the use of functions that accept format strings as arguments, where these format strings originate from untrusted external sources. This can lead to severe security risks such as buffer overflows, denial of service (DoS), or data representation issues, which exploit the underlying memory and execution control of the application. While format strings are useful and often necessary for operations like internationalization, where they are controlled externally by design, they pose a significant threat if not properly handled or if the sources of the format strings are not trustworthy. 

Furthermore, this weakness can manifest during implementation phases, especially when programmers inadvertently allow format strings to be externally controlled, such as in logging operations. The exploitation of format strings can result in unauthorized read or modification of memory, execution of arbitrary code, and potentially full system compromise. The prevalence of this issue is significant in C and C++ due to their handling and usage of format strings, but it is notably less common in languages like Perl. Mitigation strategies involve ensuring format strings are static, not user-controlled, and that all format string functions are supplied with the correct number of arguments. Also, compilers and linkers set to high warning levels can aid in detection, as well as adopting languages or functions that do not support potentially dangerous format string operators like %n.

CWE-281 describes the issue of "Improper Preservation of Permissions" where a product fails to maintain or incorrectly maintains the permissions when copying, restoring, or sharing objects. This mismanagement leads to objects having less restrictive permissions than intended, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized modifications. This weakness is characterized as a Base level problem, suggesting it has sufficient detail for specific detection and prevention methods while remaining somewhat independent of the technology or resource involved. It's crucial for various roles, including tool developers, security researchers, and incident response analysts, to understand and address this weakness to prevent security vulnerabilities. Examples of real-world exploit scenarios include incorrect Access Control Lists (ACLs) restoration from backups using symbolic links, automatic permission modifications inherited from another file system, insecure defaults in permissions on backup files, and files becoming world-readable during cloning. These instances underscore the necessity of careful permission preservation processes to safeguard against unintended permission laxity.

CWE-1095, identified as "Loop Condition Value Update within the Loop," is a base-level weakness that arises when a loop's control flow condition depends on a value that is updated within the body of the loop itself. This design pattern complicates the understanding and maintenance of the software, indirectly affecting its security by making it more challenging and time-consuming to identify and correct vulnerabilities. Moreover, this complexity may inadvertently make it easier to introduce additional vulnerabilities. This weakness is categorized under the "Excessive Code Complexity" class (CWE-1120) and is considered a member of the "Complexity Issues" category (CWE-1226). The main consequence associated with this issue is reduced maintainability, pinpointing an indirect impact where the quality concern could potentially facilitate the introduction of security-relevant weaknesses or hinder their detection. This CWE is recognized as a quality issue with no direct security implications, urging developers to look for weaknesses focused on insecure behaviors with more direct security consequences. It is prohibited from being used to map to real-world vulnerabilities due to its primary classification as a quality issue.

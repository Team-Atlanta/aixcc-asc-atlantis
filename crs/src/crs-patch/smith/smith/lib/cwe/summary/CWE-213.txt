CWE-213: Exposure of Sensitive Information Due to Incompatible Policies is identified as a vulnerability whereby a product's functionality unintentionally exposes sensitive information due to discrepancies between the developer's security policy and the security expectations of other stakeholders, such as administrators, users, or individuals whose data is being processed. This weakness arises from a product treating information as non-sensitive, in contrast to the anticipated privacy norms or policies of other involved parties. The core of this issue lies in the developer's responsibility to acknowledge and protect information considered sensitive by various stakeholders, ensuring that their security policies align with those of the product's users. If overlooked, this misalignment can facilitate unauthorized access to sensitive data, violating user expectations and potentially leading to privacy breaches. The categorization of this vulnerability is at the base level of abstraction, illustrating scenarios that are broadly applicable across different technologies and resources but detailed enough to guide specific methods for detection and prevention. Demonstrative examples include cases where web applications improperly display sensitive information like Social Security and credit card numbers without necessity, underlining the importance of understanding and respecting the sensitive nature of data from the perspective of all stakeholders involved.

This vulnerability underscores the need for comprehensive security policies that encapsulate the expectations of all relevant stakeholders regarding sensitive information. Failure to align a productâ€™s functionalities with these policies can lead to unintended information exposure, making it critical for developers to meticulously manage how sensitive data is handled, shared, and accessed within their applications.

CWE-1048 describes a software weakness where callable control elements, such as functions or methods, reference an excessive number of other application objects external to their context, leading to a high Fan-Out value. The default threshold for what is considered "excessively large" is proposed by CISQ as more than five referenced objects. This problem complicates maintenance efforts because the dense network of dependencies makes it harder and more time-consuming to identify and correct vulnerabilities, potentially increasing the risk of introducing new security flaws. While primarily viewed as a quality issue with indirect security implications, this weakness reflects poor coding practices that can indirectly compromise the security by affecting maintainability. It falls under several categories, including Bad Coding Practices and Poor Coding Practices recognized by CISQ Measures for Maintainability, and is seen as an instance of improper adherence to coding standards. This CWE is informed by research concepts and software development perspectives, emphasizing the need for clear, manageable code structures to support secure software development life cycles.

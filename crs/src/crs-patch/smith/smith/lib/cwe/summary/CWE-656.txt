CWE-656 is focused on the security vulnerability that arises from relying on "security through obscurity." This approach uses a protection mechanism whose effectiveness heavily depends on the secrecy of its algorithms or key data. If these elements become known, the protection is easily bypassed. While adding a layer of obscurity can be part of a broader defense strategy by increasing the attacker's workload, it poses a significant risk if it serves as the primary defense mechanism. The vulnerability is not specific to any programming language or technology but stems from a design philosophy that underestimates the capability of attackers to reverse-engineer or bypass the obscured mechanisms. Common consequences of exploiting such a vulnerability include breaches of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, effectively nullifying the security measures in place. Potential mitigations involve acknowledging the possibility of reverse engineering in the design phase and opting for publicly vetted algorithms and security practices. This vulnerability is indicative of a broader category of design issues where security is not adequately integrated into the architectural and implementation phases.

CWE-483, titled "Incorrect Block Delimitation," addresses a logical error introduced when a block intended to contain multiple statements is not explicitly delimited, such as with braces in certain programming languages where they are optional. This oversight can lead to situations where a programmer expects certain code statements to be executed as part of a conditional block, but due to missing delimiters, some statements may execute regardless of the conditional check, leading to unforeseen and potentially harmful outcomes. This issue is identified as a base-level weakness, suggesting that while it is somewhat independent of specific resources or technologies, it holds enough detail to guide the detection and prevention of relevant security flaws. The error primarily surfaces in languages like C and C++, where block delimiters can be omitted. The security impact revolves around altering execution logic, where incorrect behaviors might introduce vulnerabilities, especially in security-critical conditions such as making security decisions or detecting critical errors. Recommended mitigations include the use of explicit block delimitation and employing static analysis tools to enforce this practice, aiming to prevent such logic errors from compromising software security. Detected instances of this weakness highlight its potential to create inadvertent control flow paths that could destabilize the application's intended security posture.

CWE-624, categorized under "Executable Regular Expression Error," describes a vulnerability arising from the misuse of regular expressions in programming. This vulnerability can occur in two main forms: firstly, where a regular expression incorporates an executable component that is influenced by user-controlled inputs, and secondly, where a user is able to trigger execution through the insertion of pattern modifiers. A notable example of this vulnerability can be observed in the PHP `preg_replace()` function among others, wherein user-supplied input is inserted into a string that is subsequently treated as a regular expression. This vulnerability is a base-level weakness, meaning it is relatively independent of specific resources or technologies but detailed enough to discuss detection and mitigation approaches. It is mentioned to be associated with improper neutralization of special elements used in a command ('Command Injection'). The implications of exploiting this vulnerability include unauthorized code execution affecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Mitigation strategies focus on the secure handling of regular expression inputs, emphasizing the necessity to escape or quote inputs appropriately in languages like Perl, using constructs like \Q and \E. Despite its recognition, the vulnerability is under-studied, particularly beyond the PHP examples, suggesting a potential underreporting in multiple programming languages.

CWE-1060 identifies a software weakness characterized by an excessive number of inefficient server-side data queries, which fail to utilize efficient data processing mechanisms such as stored procedures. This condition can significantly diminish a product's performance, mainly due to the computational overhead introduced by numerous data access operations. The lack of efficiency becomes particularly critical if attackers can exploit the sluggish performance, potentially turning it into a security vulnerability. While the threshold for what constitutes "too many data queries" is subject to interpretation, CISQ suggests a maximum of five data queries for a function or procedure to be considered efficient. This weakness falls under the category of base weaknesses, pointing to issues that, while somewhat independent of specific technologies or resources, contain enough detail to guide detection and prevention efforts. The nature of CWE-1060 makes it more of an indirect security concern, as it primarily impacts quality and performance rather than posing a direct security threat. Nevertheless, understanding and addressing this weakness is crucial for maintaining the overall health and security posture of software systems.

CWE-915 pertains to the improper control over the modification of object attributes that are determined dynamically, posing a significant security risk. This vulnerability arises when a product receives input that specifies various attributes, properties, or fields to be initialized or updated within an object, but fails to adequately control which of these can be modified. If an object contains attributes meant solely for internal use, their unauthorized alteration could lead to critical vulnerabilities, manifesting through mechanisms such as mass assignment, autobinding, or object injection, depending on the programming language or framework involved. This weakness has broad implications across various programming languages and frameworks, making it a prevalent issue in both software and web application security. Potential consequences of exploiting this weakness include modification of sensitive data or variables, execution of unauthorized code, and other impacts that generally compromise the integrity of the application or system. Effective mitigation strategies involve employing allowlists to explicitly declare modifiable attributes, practicing careful input validation, and refactoring code to limit dynamic identification and manipulation of object attributes.

CWE-167, titled "Improper Handling of Additional Special Element," identifies a vulnerability that arises when software incorrectly handles or fails to handle unexpected special elements included in input from an upstream component. This weakness, situated at the base level of abstraction, indicates it is sufficiently independent of specific technologies but detailed enough to guide the detection and prevention of such vulnerabilities. It falls under broader classes of weaknesses related to improper handling of syntactically invalid structures (CWE-228) and improper handling of invalid uses of special elements (CWE-159), emphasizing issues in behavior, property, technology, language, and resource to varying degrees.

The vulnerability encapsulates scenarios where unanticipated extra special elements within input could lead to unexpected system states or behaviors, compromising integrity. Real-world examples include bypassing security measures through additional "<" characters in input that should not allow such elements. To mitigate this vulnerability, developers are advised to employ strict input validation strategies that favor whitelisting acceptable inputs and thoroughly scrutinize input for all relevant properties, including length, type, and syntax, conforming strictly to business rules and specifications. This proactive approach of "accept known good" could be bolstered by appropriate encoding and escaping of inputs where necessary, timely decoding, and canonicalization to match the application's internal representation, aiming to prevent misuse of input handling as an attack vector.

CWE-609, Double-Checked Locking, identifies a concurrency weakness where an attempt is made to reduce synchronization overhead with a resource by employing double-checked locking. However, this locking mechanism is inadequately implemented. In essence, double-checked locking occurs when a resource's initialization state is checked twice - once before acquiring a lock and once after - to ensure that it is only initialized if not already done so. This pattern is problematic because it does not guarantee consistent operation across all programming languages and hardware architectures. Properly synchronized blocks ensure operations are seen and executed in the order they appear, a guarantee that double-checked locking fails to uphold. This can lead to scenarios where threads operating outside these blocks may perceive or execute operations in an unintended sequence, compromising data integrity and application logic. This technique, particularly in Java before version 1.5, is inherently flawed due to its reliance on specific memory model behaviors not guaranteed to be consistent across different platforms, leading to potential race conditions and improper object initialization. Proper mitigations include avoiding double-checked locking or utilizing specific language features, such as the "volatile" keyword in Java 1.5 and later, which can correctly implement double-checked locking patterns.

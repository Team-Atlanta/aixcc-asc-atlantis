CWE-524 refers to the use of a cache that contains sensitive information accessible to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing attackers to read and obtain this sensitive data. Applications often utilize caches to store a variety of objects, threads, connections, pages, financial data, passwords, or other resources to improve efficiency in communication with remote entities or during intensive computations. However, if these caches are not adequately protected, they can become a significant security vulnerability. The weakness is classified as a Base level in terms of abstraction, indicating it provides enough detail to outline specific detection and prevention methods while remaining mostly independent of a particular resource or technology. Mitigation strategies involve protecting the information stored in caches, avoiding the storage of excessively sensitive information in caches, and considering the use of encryption to secure cache content. Detection of this weakness is highly effective via automated static analysis, which analyzes code to identify potentially vulnerable patterns without executing the code. The vulnerability is placed under broader categories related to information management errors and insecure session management, highlighting its relevance across different aspects of software development and security.

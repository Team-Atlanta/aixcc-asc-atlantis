CWE-826 addresses the issue of a premature release of a resource that should still be valid and in use, either by the software itself or another actor. This base-level weakness focuses on situations where a software product erroneously releases a resource it should retain, rather than correctly releasing a resource but maintaining an unsafe reference to it. The core of the weakness lies in the undue release, after which the software might inadvertently operate on the now-invalid resource. This could lead to it being repurposed, triggering various security issues akin to those seen in CWE-825, including denial of service, information exposure, or code execution. The consequences are broadly categorized under confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts, ranging from unauthorized data access or modification to software crashes and arbitrary code execution.

The relationships and observed instances of CWE-826, as cataloged by MITRE, suggest its relevance across different aspects of resource management errors and business logic errors. Despite its significance, as of September 2010, it was considered under-studied and under-reported, especially beyond the context of memory management. Examples include vulnerabilities that arise from race conditions leading to improper resource release and access violations. This weakness, part of the Common Weakness Enumeration, is intended to guide both the identification of potential vulnerabilities in software and the development of methodologies to prevent their occurrence, highlighting the need for careful resource management and validation throughout the software lifecycle.

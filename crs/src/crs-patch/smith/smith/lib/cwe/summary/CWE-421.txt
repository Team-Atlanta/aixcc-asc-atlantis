CWE-421 describes a race condition vulnerability that arises when a software product opens an alternative communication channel intended for use by authorized users, but which can be accessed by unauthorized actors as well. This condition creates a security flaw where an attacker can exploit the race condition by accessing the channel before the intended, authorized user does. Such vulnerabilities often stem from improper synchronization or handling of shared resources, allowing for potential unauthorized access control breaches, including gaining privileges, assuming identity, or bypassing protection mechanisms. Examples of this issue include vulnerabilities where attackers connect to ports or pipes meant for other clients, potentially hijacking authentication processes or other sensitive operations. This weakness is categorized under the Base level of abstraction, indicating it provides enough detail to outline specific methods for detection and prevention without being tied to a particular technology or resource. It is crucial for developers and security professionals to be aware of such vulnerabilities during the architecture and design phases of software development to implement appropriate safety measures and mitigations.

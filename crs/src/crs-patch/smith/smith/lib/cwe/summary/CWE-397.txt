CWE-397 concerns the practice of declaring methods to throw generic exceptions in programming, specifically targeting the weaknesses it introduces into error handling and recovery processes. When a method is declared to throw a broad exception such as `Exception` or `Throwable`, it inhibits precise error handling by callers, undermining Java's exception mechanism designed to enable specific handling for various exceptional circumstances. This overly generic approach to exception declaration can complicate error handling code, increasing the likelihood of security vulnerabilities. Relevant examples demonstrate how specifying exact exceptions that a method may throw, as opposed to a generic exception, assists in cleaner and more secure code maintenance and development. Additionally, the issue extends to C++ under certain versions through a feature known as Dynamic Exception Specification, noting its deprecation and eventual removal in later versions. Automated static analysis tools are noted for their high effectiveness in identifying instances of this weakness by analyzing source or compiled code without execution. The CWE entry falls under several broader categories related to error management and control flow issues, highlighting its importance in secure coding standards and quality assurance practices.

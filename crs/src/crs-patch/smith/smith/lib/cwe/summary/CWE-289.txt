The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) 289 refers to "Authentication Bypass by Alternate Name," a vulnerability stemming from improper authentication checks by software products. This base-level weakness occurs when a system performs authentication based on a resource or actor's name but fails to properly scrutinize all potential names or aliases. Such inadequacy typically relates to insufficient validation methods that do not account for alternate naming conventions, encoding discrepancies, or case sensitivity, allowing attackers to exploit these oversights to bypass authentication mechanisms inadvertently. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and control, making it crucial for security mechanisms to avoid decision-making processes based solely on resource names and to implement comprehensive input validation strategies. Effective mitigation involves employing an "accept known good" input validation approach, rigorously checking inputs against a strict specification of acceptable values, and ensuring inputs are decoded and canonicalized to a consistent internal application representation before validation. This CWE entry is intrinsically linked to various similar weaknesses and provides a foundational understanding for addressing a broad spectrum of authentication bypass issues.

CWE-257 addresses the security weakness of storing passwords in a recoverable format, posing a significant risk for password reuse attacks by malicious entities. Passwords stored in a manner that allows them to be recovered, either in plaintext or through reversible encryption, effectively offer no security advantage over plaintext passwords. This vulnerability exposes user accounts to potential unauthorized access, as it enables attackers, including insiders with sufficient privileges, to obtain and reuse passwords across different systems or accounts. The scope of this issue spans across various languages and is not specific to any particular programming language, indicating its widespread relevance.

Various examples provided, including those in C and Java, illustrate scenarios where passwords are stored in a format that could be reversed or retrieved, thereby compromising the security of the system. The consequences of exploiting this weakness could range from unauthorized access to gaining privileged access, depending on the attackers' intentions and the specific context of the application. Mitigating this vulnerability involves adopting secure practices in password management, such as employing strong, non-reversible encryption techniques for storing passwords and ensuring that passwords are handled securely throughout their lifecycle, from creation and storage to transmission and authentication processes.

The CWE-805 entry refers to a software vulnerability where there's incorrect management of buffer length values during read or write operations. This often results in accessing memory outside the intended buffer space. The central issue originates from using a length value that doesn't accurately represent the buffer's limit, potentially leading to buffer overflows when the specified length exceeds the buffer's capacity. This vulnerability is critical as it touches on the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system, allowing attackers to read, modify memory, or execute unauthorized commands. Often prevalent in languages like C and C++, which lack built-in safety checks for buffer sizes, the oversight introduces substantial security risks. Mitigating strategies include adopting languages or environments that inhibit or reduce the likelihood of buffer overflow, employing vetted libraries/frameworks designed to manage buffers securely, and integrating automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms in the development process. Additionally, employing environment hardening techniques such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) or compilers/extensions that offer buffer overflow protections can further diminish the risk of exploitation.

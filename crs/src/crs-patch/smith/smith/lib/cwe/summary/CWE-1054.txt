CWE-1054 pertains to a structural weakness within software architecture, characterized by a control element's invocation at an excessively deep horizontal layer, bypassing one or more adjacent layers and excluding instances where the invoked code belongs to a vertical utility layer accessible from any horizontal layer. This architectural flaw complicates the understanding and maintenance of the software, obliquely impacting security by potentially making it more challenging and time-consuming to identify and rectify vulnerabilities, as well as possibly facilitating the introduction of further vulnerabilities. Essentially, this issue represents a deviation from optimal encapsulation practices, where direct communication skips intended architectural boundaries, leading to a deterioration in code maintainability and an increase in the risk of indirect security vulnerabilities due to the heightened complexity and reduced transparency in the code's structure.

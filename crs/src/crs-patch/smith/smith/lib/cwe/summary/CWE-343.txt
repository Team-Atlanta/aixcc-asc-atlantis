CWE-343 pertains to a scenario where a product's random number generator (RNG) exhibits predictable value ranges based on its previously generated values. This undermines the core principle that the output of a RNG should be unpredictable, thus ensuring the security and integrity of the processes reliant on these values. However, when the next value in the sequence can be narrowed down to a significantly reduced range of possibilities, it drastically lowers the complexity for an attacker aiming to perform a brute force attack. For example, if an RNG designed to produce values between 1 and 100 predictably outputs a higher number until it reaches 100, observing an output of 80 would imply the next number will be between 81 and 100â€”reducing a brute-force attacker's workload from 100 to just 20 possibilities. To mitigate such a weakness, increasing the entropy used to seed the RNG is recommended, alongside utilizing PRNGs that reseed themselves periodically with high-quality, high-entropy sources, but not so frequently that it causes the entropy source to block. Ensuring the use of modules that adhere to standards like FIPS 140-2 can also help in mitigating obvious entropy-related issues. This weakness is not specific to any programming language and has a variety of consequences depending on the application context, highlighting the essential need for secure RNG practices in software design and implementation.

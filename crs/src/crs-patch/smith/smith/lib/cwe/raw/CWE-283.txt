 CWE-283: Unverified Ownership
 
 Weakness ID: 283
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 Architecture and Design REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.
 + Applicable Platforms
 Section HelpThis listing shows possible areas for which the given weakness could appear. These may be for specific named Languages, Operating Systems, Architectures, Paradigms, Technologies, or a
 class of such platforms. The platform is listed along with how frequently the given weakness appears for that instance.

 Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.
       Scope                                                                                     Impact                                                                                 Likelihood
                    Technical Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
 Access Control
                    An attacker could gain unauthorized access to system resources.
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 This function is part of a privileged program that takes input from users with potentially lower privileges.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Python 
 def killProcess(processID):
 os.kill(processID, signal.SIGKILL)

 This code does not confirm that the process to be killed is owned by the requesting user, thus allowing an attacker to kill arbitrary processes.

 This function remedies the problem by checking the owner of the process before killing it:

 (good code)
 Example Language: Python 
 def killProcess(processID):
 user = getCurrentUser()

 #Check process owner against requesting user
 if getProcessOwner(processID) == user:
 os.kill(processID, signal.SIGKILL)
 return

 else:
 print("You cannot kill a process you don't own")
 return

 CVE-2001-0178           Program does not verify the owner of a UNIX socket that is used for sending a password.
 CVE-2004-2012           Owner of special device not checked, allowing root.
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phases: Architecture and Design; Operation

 Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Strategy: Separation of Privilege

 Consider following the principle of separation of privilege. Require multiple conditions to be met before permitting access to a system resource.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

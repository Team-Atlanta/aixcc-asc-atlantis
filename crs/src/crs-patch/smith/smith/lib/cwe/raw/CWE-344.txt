 CWE-344: Use of Invariant Value in Dynamically Changing Context
 
 Weakness ID: 344
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product uses a constant value, name, or reference, but this value can (or should) vary across different environments.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

 Other              Technical Impact: Varies by Context

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 The following code is an example of an internal hard-coded password in the back-end:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
 if (strcmp(password, "Mew!")) {
 printf("Incorrect Password!\n");
 return(0)
 }
 printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");
 return(1);
 }
 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 int VerifyAdmin(String password) {
 if (!password.equals("Mew!")) {
 return(0)
 }
 //Diagnostic Mode
 return(1);
 }

 Every instance of this program can be placed into diagnostic mode with the same password. Even worse is the fact that if this program is distributed as a binary-only distribution, it is very
 difficult to change that password or disable this "functionality."

 Example 2

 This code assumes a particular function will always be found at a particular address. It assigns a pointer to that address and calls the function.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 int (*pt2Function) (float, char, char)=0x08040000;
 int result2 = (*pt2Function) (12, 'a', 'b');
 // Here we can inject code to execute.

 The same function may not always be found at the same memory address. This could lead to a crash, or an attacker may alter the memory at the expected address, leading to arbitrary code execution.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

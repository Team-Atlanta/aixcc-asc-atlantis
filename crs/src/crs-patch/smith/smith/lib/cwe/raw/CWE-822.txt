 CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference
 
 Weakness ID: 822
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer.
 + Extended Description
 
 An attacker can supply a pointer for memory locations that the product is not expecting. If the pointer is dereferenced for a write operation, the attack might allow modification of critical state
 variables, cause a crash, or execute code. If the dereferencing operation is for a read, then the attack might allow reading of sensitive data, cause a crash, or set a variable to an unexpected value
 (since the value will be read from an unexpected memory location).

 There are several variants of this weakness, including but not necessarily limited to:

   • The untrusted value is directly invoked as a function call.
   • In OS kernels or drivers where there is a boundary between "userland" and privileged memory spaces, an untrusted pointer might enter through an API or system call (see CWE-781 for one such
     example).
   • Inadvertently accepting the value from an untrusted control sphere when it did not have to be accepted as input at all. This might occur when the code was originally developed to be run by a
     single user in a non-networked environment, and the code is then ported to or otherwise exposed to a networked environment.

 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.
       Scope                                                                                     Impact                                                                                 Likelihood
                    Technical Impact: Read Memory
 Confidentiality
                    If the untrusted pointer is used in a read operation, an attacker might be able to read sensitive portions of memory.
                    Technical Impact: DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart
 Availability
                    If the untrusted pointer references a memory location that is not accessible to the product, or points to a location that is "malformed" or larger than expected
                    by a read or write operation, the application may terminate unexpectedly.
 Integrity          Technical Impact: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands; Modify Memory
 Confidentiality
 Availability       If the untrusted pointer is used in a function call, or points to unexpected data in a write operation, then code execution may be possible.

 CVE-2007-5655           message-passing framework interprets values in packets as pointers, causing a crash.
 CVE-2010-2299           labeled as a "type confusion" issue, also referred to as a "stale pointer." However, the bug ID says "contents are simply interpreted as a pointer... renderer ordinarily
                         doesn't supply this pointer directly". The "handle" in the untrusted area is replaced in one function, but not another - thus also, effectively, exposure to wrong sphere (
                         CWE-668).
 CVE-2009-1719           Untrusted dereference using undocumented constructor.
 CVE-2009-1250           An error code is incorrectly checked and interpreted as a pointer, leading to a crash.
 CVE-2009-0311           An untrusted value is obtained from a packet and directly called as a function pointer, leading to code execution.
 CVE-2010-1818           Undocumented attribute in multimedia software allows "unmarshaling" of an untrusted pointer.
 CVE-2010-3189           ActiveX control for security software accepts a parameter that is assumed to be an initialized pointer.
 CVE-2010-1253           Spreadsheet software treats certain record values that lead to "user-controlled pointer" (might be untrusted offset, not untrusted pointer).

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.
 + Notes
 
 Terminology

 Many weaknesses related to pointer dereferences fall under the general term of "memory corruption" or "memory safety." As of September 2010, there is no commonly-used terminology that covers the
 lower-level variants.

 Maintenance

 There are close relationships between incorrect pointer dereferences and other weaknesses related to buffer operations. There may not be sufficient community agreement regarding these relationships.
 Further study is needed to determine when these relationships are chains, composites, perspective/layering, or other types of relationships. As of September 2010, most of the relationships are being
 captured as chains.

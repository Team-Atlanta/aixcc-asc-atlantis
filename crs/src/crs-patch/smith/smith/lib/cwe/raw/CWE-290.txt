 CWE-290: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
 
 Weakness ID: 290
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 This attack-focused weakness is caused by incorrectly implemented authentication schemes that are subject to spoofing attacks.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 Implementation
 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

                    Technical Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism; Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
 Access Control
                    This weakness can allow an attacker to access resources which are not otherwise accessible without proper authentication.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 String sourceIP = request.getRemoteAddr();
 if (sourceIP != null && sourceIP.equals(APPROVED_IP)) {
 authenticated = true;
 }

 The authentication mechanism implemented relies on an IP address for source validation. If an attacker is able to spoof the IP, they may be able to bypass the authentication mechanism.

 Example 2

 Both of these examples check if a request is from a trusted address before responding to the request.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 sd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
 serv.sin_family = AF_INET;
 serv.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);
 servr.sin_port = htons(1008);
 bind(sd, (struct sockaddr *) & serv, sizeof(serv));

 while (1) {
 memset(msg, 0x0, MAX_MSG);
 clilen = sizeof(cli);
 if (inet_ntoa(cli.sin_addr)==getTrustedAddress()) {
 n = recvfrom(sd, msg, MAX_MSG, 0, (struct sockaddr *) & cli, &clilen);
 }
 }
 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 while(true) {
 DatagramPacket rp=new DatagramPacket(rData,rData.length);
 outSock.receive(rp);
 String in = new String(p.getData(),0, rp.getLength());
 InetAddress clientIPAddress = rp.getAddress();
 int port = rp.getPort();

 if (isTrustedAddress(clientIPAddress) & secretKey.equals(in)) {
 out = secret.getBytes();
 DatagramPacket sp =new DatagramPacket(out,out.length, IPAddress, port); outSock.send(sp);
 }
 }

 The code only verifies the address as stored in the request packet. An attacker can spoof this address, thus impersonating a trusted client.

 Example 3

 The following code samples use a DNS lookup in order to decide whether or not an inbound request is from a trusted host. If an attacker can poison the DNS cache, they can gain trusted status.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 struct hostent *hp;struct in_addr myaddr;
 char* tHost = "trustme.example.com";
 myaddr.s_addr=inet_addr(ip_addr_string);

 hp = gethostbyaddr((char *) &myaddr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);
 if (hp && !strncmp(hp->h_name, tHost, sizeof(tHost))) {
 trusted = true;
 } else {
 trusted = false;
 }
 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 String ip = request.getRemoteAddr();
 InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getByName(ip);
 if (addr.getCanonicalHostName().endsWith("trustme.com")) {
 trusted = true;
 }
 (bad code)
 Example Language: C# 
 IPAddress hostIPAddress = IPAddress.Parse(RemoteIpAddress);
 IPHostEntry hostInfo = Dns.GetHostByAddress(hostIPAddress);
 if (hostInfo.HostName.EndsWith("trustme.com")) {
 trusted = true;
 }

 IP addresses are more reliable than DNS names, but they can also be spoofed. Attackers can easily forge the source IP address of the packets they send, but response packets will return to the forged
 IP address. To see the response packets, the attacker has to sniff the traffic between the victim machine and the forged IP address. In order to accomplish the required sniffing, attackers typically
 attempt to locate themselves on the same subnet as the victim machine. Attackers may be able to circumvent this requirement by using source routing, but source routing is disabled across much of the
 Internet today. In summary, IP address verification can be a useful part of an authentication scheme, but it should not be the single factor required for authentication.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

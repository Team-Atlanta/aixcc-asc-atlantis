 CWE-257: Storing Passwords in a Recoverable Format
 
 Weakness ID: 257
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The storage of passwords in a recoverable format makes them subject to password reuse attacks by malicious users. In fact, it should be noted that recoverable encrypted passwords provide no
 significant benefit over plaintext passwords since they are subject not only to reuse by malicious attackers but also by malicious insiders. If a system administrator can recover a password directly,
 or use a brute force search on the available information, the administrator can use the password on other accounts.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 Architecture and Design COMMISSION: This weakness refers to an incorrect design related to an architectural security tactic.
 + Applicable Platforms
 Section HelpThis listing shows possible areas for which the given weakness could appear. These may be for specific named Languages, Operating Systems, Architectures, Paradigms, Technologies, or a
 class of such platforms. The platform is listed along with how frequently the given weakness appears for that instance.

 Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.
       Scope                                                                                     Impact                                                                                 Likelihood
 Confidentiality    Technical Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity

                    Revealed passwords may be reused elsewhere to impersonate the users in question.
 + Likelihood Of Exploit

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 Both of these examples verify a password by comparing it to a stored compressed version.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 int VerifyAdmin(char *password) {
 if (strcmp(compress(password), compressed_password)) {
 printf("Incorrect Password!\n");
 return(0);
 }
 printf("Entering Diagnostic Mode...\n");
 return(1);
 }
 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 int VerifyAdmin(String password) {
 if (passwd.Equals(compress(password), compressed_password)) {
 return(0);
 }
 //Diagnostic Mode
 return(1);
 }

 Because a compression algorithm is used instead of a one way hashing algorithm, an attacker can recover compressed passwords stored in the database.

 Example 2

 The following examples show a portion of properties and configuration files for Java and ASP.NET applications. The files include username and password information but they are stored in cleartext.

 This Java example shows a properties file with a cleartext username / password pair.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 

 # Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file
 ...
 webapp.ldap.username=secretUsername
 webapp.ldap.password=secretPassword
 ...

 The following example shows a portion of a configuration file for an ASP.Net application. This configuration file includes username and password information for a connection to a database but the
 pair is stored in cleartext.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: ASP.NET 
 ...
 <connectionStrings>
 <add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" />
 </connectionStrings>
 ...

 Username and password information should not be included in a configuration file or a properties file in cleartext as this will allow anyone who can read the file access to the resource. If possible,
 encrypt this information.

 + Weakness Ordinalities
 Ordinality                                                                                       Description
 Primary    (where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 + Detection Methods
 Automated Static Analysis

 Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without
 having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with
 "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Effectiveness: High

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.
 + Notes
 
 Maintenance

 The meaning of this entry needs to be investigated more closely, especially with respect to what is meant by "recoverable."

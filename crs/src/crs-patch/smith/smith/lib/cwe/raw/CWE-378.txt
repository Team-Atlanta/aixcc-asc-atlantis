 CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions
 
 Weakness ID: 378
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

                    Technical Impact: Read Application Data
 Confidentiality
                    If the temporary file can be read by the attacker, sensitive information may be in that file which could be revealed.
                    Technical Impact: Other
 Authorization
 Other              If that file can be written to by the attacker, the file might be moved into a place to which the attacker does not have access. This will allow the attacker to
                    gain selective resource access-control privileges.
                    Technical Impact: Other
 Integrity
 Other              Depending on the data stored in the temporary file, there is the potential for an attacker to gain an additional input vector which is trusted as non-malicious.
                    It may be possible to make arbitrary changes to data structures, user information, or even process ownership.
 + Likelihood Of Exploit
 High
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 In the following code examples a temporary file is created and written to. After using the temporary file, the file is closed and deleted from the file system.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 FILE *stream;
 if( (stream = tmpfile()) == NULL ) {

 perror("Could not open new temporary file\n");
 return (-1);
 }
 // write data to tmp file
 ...
 // remove tmp file
 rmtmp();

 However, within this C/C++ code the method tmpfile() is used to create and open the temp file. The tmpfile() method works the same way as the fopen() method would with read/write permission, allowing
 attackers to read potentially sensitive information contained in the temp file or modify the contents of the file.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 try {
 File temp = File.createTempFile("pattern", ".suffix");
 temp.deleteOnExit();
 BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(temp));
 out.write("aString");
 out.close();
 }
 catch (IOException e) {
 }

 Similarly, the createTempFile() method used in the Java code creates a temp file that may be readable and writable to all users.

 Additionally both methods used above place the file into a default directory. On UNIX systems the default directory is usually "/tmp" or "/var/tmp" and on Windows systems the default directory is
 usually "C:\\Windows\\Temp", which may be easily accessible to attackers, possibly enabling them to read and modify the contents of the temp file.

 + Observed Examples

 CVE-2022-24823          A network application framework uses the Java function createTempFile(), which will create a file that is readable by other local users of the system
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Requirements

 Many contemporary languages have functions which properly handle this condition. Older C temp file functions are especially susceptible.
 Phase: Implementation

 Ensure that you use proper file permissions. This can be achieved by using a safe temp file function. Temporary files should be writable and readable only by the process that owns the file.
 Phase: Implementation

 Randomize temporary file names. This can also be achieved by using a safe temp-file function. This will ensure that temporary files will not be created in predictable places.
 + Memberships

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

 CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information
 
 Weakness ID: 312
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product stores sensitive information in cleartext within a resource that might be accessible to another control sphere.
 + Extended Description
 
 Because the information is stored in cleartext (i.e., unencrypted), attackers could potentially read it. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques
 could determine which encoding is being used, then decode the information.

 When organizations adopt cloud services, it can be easier for attackers to access the data from anywhere on the Internet.

 In some systems/environments such as cloud, the use of "double encryption" (at both the software and hardware layer) might be required, and the developer might be solely responsible for both layers,
 instead of shared responsibility with the administrator of the broader system/environment.

 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

                    Technical Impact: Read Application Data
 Confidentiality
                    An attacker with access to the system could read sensitive information stored in cleartext.
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 The following code excerpt stores a plaintext user account ID in a browser cookie.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 response.addCookie( new Cookie("userAccountID", acctID);

 Because the account ID is in plaintext, the user's account information is exposed if their computer is compromised by an attacker.

 Example 2

 This code writes a user's login information to a cookie so the user does not have to login again later.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: PHP 
 function persistLogin($username, $password){
 $data = array("username" => $username, "password"=> $password);
 setcookie ("userdata", $data);
 }

 The code stores the user's username and password in plaintext in a cookie on the user's machine. This exposes the user's login information if their computer is compromised by an attacker. Even if the
 user's machine is not compromised, this weakness combined with cross-site scripting (CWE-79) could allow an attacker to remotely copy the cookie.

 Also note this example code also exhibits Plaintext Storage in a Cookie (CWE-315).

 Example 3

 The following code attempts to establish a connection, read in a password, then store it to a buffer.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 server.sin_family = AF_INET; hp = gethostbyname(argv[1]);
 if (hp==NULL) error("Unknown host");
 memcpy( (char *)&server.sin_addr,(char *)hp->h_addr,hp->h_length);
 if (argc < 3) port = 80;
 else port = (unsigned short)atoi(argv[3]);
 server.sin_port = htons(port);
 if (connect(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&server, sizeof server) < 0) error("Connecting");
 ...
 while ((n=read(sock,buffer,BUFSIZE-1))!=-1) {

 write(dfd,password_buffer,n);
 ...

 While successful, the program does not encrypt the data before writing it to a buffer, possibly exposing it to unauthorized actors.

 Example 4

 The following examples show a portion of properties and configuration files for Java and ASP.NET applications. The files include username and password information but they are stored in cleartext.

 This Java example shows a properties file with a cleartext username / password pair.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 

 # Java Web App ResourceBundle properties file
 ...
 webapp.ldap.username=secretUsername
 webapp.ldap.password=secretPassword
 ...

 The following example shows a portion of a configuration file for an ASP.Net application. This configuration file includes username and password information for a connection to a database but the
 pair is stored in cleartext.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: ASP.NET 
 ...
 <connectionStrings>
 <add name="ud_DEV" connectionString="connectDB=uDB; uid=db2admin; pwd=password; dbalias=uDB;" providerName="System.Data.Odbc" />
 </connectionStrings>
 ...

 Username and password information should not be included in a configuration file or a properties file in cleartext as this will allow anyone who can read the file access to the resource. If possible,
 encrypt this information.

 Example 5

 In 2022, the OT:ICEFALL study examined products by 10 different Operational Technology (OT) vendors. The researchers reported 56 vulnerabilities and said that the products were "insecure by design" [
 REF-1283]. If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed. Since
 these products were often used in industries such as power, electrical, water, and others, there could even be safety implications.

 At least one OT product stored a password in plaintext.

 Example 6

 In 2021, a web site operated by PeopleGIS stored data of US municipalities in Amazon Web Service (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) buckets.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Other 
 A security researcher found 86 S3 buckets that could be accessed without authentication (CWE-306) and stored data unencrypted (CWE-312). These buckets exposed over 1000 GB of data and 1.6 million
 files including physical addresses, phone numbers, tax documents, pictures of driver's license IDs, etc. [REF-1296] [REF-1295]

 While it was not publicly disclosed how the data was protected after discovery, multiple options could have been considered.

 (good code)
 Example Language: Other 
 The sensitive information could have been protected by ensuring that the buckets did not have public read access, e.g., by enabling the s3-account-level-public-access-blocks-periodic rule to Block
 Public Access. In addition, the data could have been encrypted at rest using the appropriate S3 settings, e.g., by enabling server-side encryption using the s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled
 setting. Other settings are available to further prevent bucket data from being leaked. [REF-1297]

 Example 7

 Consider the following PowerShell command examples for encryption scopes of Azure storage objects. In the first example, an encryption scope is set for the storage account.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Shell 
 New-AzStorageEncryptionScope -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -AccountName "MyStorageAccount" -EncryptionScopeName testscope -StorageEncryption

 The result (edited and formatted for readability) might be:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Other 
 ResourceGroupName: MyResourceGroup, StorageAccountName: MyStorageAccount

   Name     State       Source       RequireInfrastructureEncryption
 testscope Enabled Microsoft.Storage

 However, the empty string under RequireInfrastructureEncryption indicates this service was not enabled at the time of creation, because the -RequireInfrastructureEncryption argument was not specified
 in the command.

 Including the -RequireInfrastructureEncryption argument addresses the issue:

 (good code)
 Example Language: Shell 
 New-AzStorageEncryptionScope -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -AccountName "MyStorageAccount" -EncryptionScopeName testscope -StorageEncryption -RequireInfrastructureEncryption

 This produces the report:

 (result)
 Example Language: Other 
 ResourceGroupName: MyResourceGroup, StorageAccountName: MyStorageAccount

   Name     State        Source       RequireInfrastructureEncryption
 testscope Enabled Microsoft.Keyvault True

 In a scenario where both software and hardware layer encryption is required ("double encryption"), Azure's infrastructure encryption setting can be enabled via the CLI or Portal. An important note is
 that infrastructure hardware encryption cannot be enabled or disabled after a blob is created. Furthermore, the default value for infrastructure encryption is disabled in blob creations.

 + Potential Mitigations
 Phases: Implementation; System Configuration; Operation

 When storing data in the cloud (e.g., S3 buckets, Azure blobs, Google Cloud Storage, etc.), use the provider's controls to encrypt the data at rest. [REF-1297] [REF-1299] [REF-1301]
 + Detection Methods
 Automated Static Analysis

 Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without
 having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with
 "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.
 + Notes
 
 Terminology

 Different people use "cleartext" and "plaintext" to mean the same thing: the lack of encryption. However, within cryptography, these have more precise meanings. Plaintext is the information just
 before it is fed into a cryptographic algorithm, including already-encrypted text. Cleartext is any information that is unencrypted, although it might be in an encoded form that is not easily
 human-readable (such as base64 encoding).

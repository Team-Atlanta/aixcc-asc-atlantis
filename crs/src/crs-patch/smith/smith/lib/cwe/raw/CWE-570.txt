 CWE-570: Expression is Always False
 
 Weakness ID: 570
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

 Other              Technical Impact: Quality Degradation; Varies by Context

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 In the following Java example the updateUserAccountOrder() method used within an e-business product ordering/inventory application will validate the product number that was ordered and the user
 account number. If they are valid, the method will update the product inventory, the user account, and the user order appropriately.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 

 public void updateUserAccountOrder(String productNumber, String accountNumber) {
 boolean isValidProduct = false;
 boolean isValidAccount = false;

 if (validProductNumber(productNumber)) {
 isValidProduct = true;
 updateInventory(productNumber);
 }
 else {
 return;
 }

 if (validAccountNumber(accountNumber)) {
 isValidProduct = true;
 updateAccount(accountNumber, productNumber);
 }

 if (isValidProduct && isValidAccount) {
 updateAccountOrder(accountNumber, productNumber);
 }
 }

 However, the method never sets the isValidAccount variable after initializing it to false so the isValidProduct is mistakenly used twice. The result is that the expression "isValidProduct &&
 isValidAccount" will always evaluate to false, so the updateAccountOrder() method will never be invoked. This will create serious problems with the product ordering application since the user account
 and inventory databases will be updated but the order will not be updated.

 This can be easily corrected by updating the appropriate variable.

 (good code)
  
 ...
 if (validAccountNumber(accountNumber)) {
 isValidAccount = true;
 updateAccount(accountNumber, productNumber);
 }
 ...

 Example 2

 In the following example, the hasReadWriteAccess method uses bit masks and bit operators to determine if a user has read and write privileges for a particular process. The variable mask is defined as
 a bit mask from the BIT_READ and BIT_WRITE constants that have been defined. The variable mask is used within the predicate of the hasReadWriteAccess method to determine if the userMask input
 parameter has the read and write bits set.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 #define BIT_READ 0x0001 // 00000001
 #define BIT_WRITE 0x0010 // 00010000

 unsigned int mask = BIT_READ & BIT_WRITE; /* intended to use "|" */

 // using "&", mask = 00000000
 // using "|", mask = 00010001

 // determine if user has read and write access
 int hasReadWriteAccess(unsigned int userMask) {
 // if the userMask has read and write bits set
 // then return 1 (true)
 if (userMask & mask) {
 return 1;
 }

 // otherwise return 0 (false)
 return 0;
 }

 However the bit operator used to initialize the mask variable is the AND operator rather than the intended OR operator (CWE-480), this resulted in the variable mask being set to 0. As a result, the
 if statement will always evaluate to false and never get executed.

 The use of bit masks, bit operators and bitwise operations on variables can be difficult. If possible, try to use frameworks or libraries that provide appropriate functionality and abstract the
 implementation.

 Example 3

 In the following example, the updateInventory method used within an e-business inventory application will update the inventory for a particular product. This method includes an if statement with an
 expression that will always evaluate to false. This is a common practice in C/C++ to introduce debugging statements quickly by simply changing the expression to evaluate to true and then removing
 those debugging statements by changing expression to evaluate to false. This is also a common practice for disabling features no longer needed.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 int updateInventory(char* productNumber, int numberOfItems) {
 int initCount = getProductCount(productNumber);

 int updatedCount = initCount + numberOfItems;

 int updated = updateProductCount(updatedCount);

 // if statement for debugging purposes only
 if (1 == 0) {

 char productName[128];
 productName = getProductName(productNumber);

 printf("product %s initially has %d items in inventory \n", productName, initCount);
 printf("adding %d items to inventory for %s \n", numberOfItems, productName);

 if (updated == 0) {
 printf("Inventory updated for product %s to %d items \n", productName, updatedCount);
 }

 else {
 printf("Inventory not updated for product: %s \n", productName);
 }
 }

 return updated;
 }

 Using this practice for introducing debugging statements or disabling features creates dead code that can cause problems during code maintenance and potentially introduce vulnerabilities. To avoid
 using expressions that evaluate to false for debugging purposes a logging API or debugging API should be used for the output of debugging messages.

 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Testing

 Use Static Analysis tools to spot such conditions.
 + Detection Methods
 Automated Static Analysis

 Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without
 having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with
 "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

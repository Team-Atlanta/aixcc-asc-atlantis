 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: PROHIBITED

 (this CWE ID must not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Category

 Rationale:

 This entry is a Category. Using categories for mapping has been discouraged since 2019. Categories are informal organizational groupings of weaknesses that can help CWE users with data
 aggregation, navigation, and browsing. However, they are not weaknesses in themselves [REF-1287]. This CWE ID may have become widely-used because of NIST's usage in NVD from 2008 to 2016 (see
 CWE-635 view, updated to the CWE-1003 view in 2016).
 Comments:

 Most number-handling issues are probably descendants under Incorrect Calculation (CWE-682) or Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types (CWE-681).

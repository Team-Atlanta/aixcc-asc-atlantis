 CWE-628: Function Call with Incorrectly Specified Arguments
 
 Weakness ID: 628
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product calls a function, procedure, or routine with arguments that are not correctly specified, leading to always-incorrect behavior and resultant weaknesses.
 + Extended Description
 
 There are multiple ways in which this weakness can be introduced, including:

   • the wrong variable or reference;
   • an incorrect number of arguments;
   • incorrect order of arguments;
   • wrong type of arguments; or
   • wrong value.

 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 class of such platforms. The platform is listed along with how frequently the given weakness appears for that instance.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

 Other              Technical Impact: Quality Degradation; Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
 Access Control
                    This weakness can cause unintended behavior and can lead to additional weaknesses such as allowing an attacker to gain unintended access to system resources.
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 The following PHP method authenticates a user given a username/password combination but is called with the parameters in reverse order.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: PHP 
 function authenticate($username, $password) {

 // authenticate user
 ...
 }

 authenticate($_POST['password'], $_POST['username']);

 Example 2

 This Perl code intends to record whether a user authenticated successfully or not, and to exit if the user fails to authenticate. However, when it calls ReportAuth(), the third argument is specified
 as 0 instead of 1, so it does not exit.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Perl 
 sub ReportAuth {
 my ($username, $result, $fatal) = @_;
 PrintLog("auth: username=%s, result=%d", $username, $result);
 if (($result ne "success") && $fatal) {
 die "Failed!\n";
 }
 }

 sub PrivilegedFunc
 {
 my $result = CheckAuth($username);
 ReportAuth($username, $result, 0);
 DoReallyImportantStuff();
 }

 Example 3

 In the following Java snippet, the accessGranted() method is accidentally called with the static ADMIN_ROLES array rather than the user roles.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 private static final String[] ADMIN_ROLES = ...;
 public boolean void accessGranted(String resource, String user) {
 String[] userRoles = getUserRoles(user);
 return accessGranted(resource, ADMIN_ROLES);
 }

 private boolean void accessGranted(String resource, String[] userRoles) {

 // grant or deny access based on user roles
 ...
 }

 CVE-2006-7049           The method calls the functions with the wrong argument order, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Build and Compilation

 Once found, these issues are easy to fix. Use code inspection tools and relevant compiler features to identify potential violations. Pay special attention to code that is not likely to be
 exercised heavily during QA.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Make sure your API's are stable before you use them in production code.
 + Weakness Ordinalities
 Ordinality                                                                                       Description
 Primary    (where the weakness is a quality issue that might indirectly make it easier to introduce security-relevant weaknesses or make them more difficult to detect)
            This is usually primary to other weaknesses, but it can be resultant if the function's API or function prototype changes.
 + Detection Methods
 Other

 Since these bugs typically introduce incorrect behavior that is obvious to users, they are found quickly, unless they occur in rarely-tested code paths. Managing the correct number of arguments
 can be made more difficult in cases where format strings are used, or when variable numbers of arguments are supported.
 + Memberships
 Section HelpThis MemberOf Relationships table shows additional CWE Categories and Views that reference this weakness as a member. This information is often useful in understanding where a weakness
 fits within the context of external information sources.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

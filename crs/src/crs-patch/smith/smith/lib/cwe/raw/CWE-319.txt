 CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
 
 Weakness ID: 319
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product transmits sensitive or security-critical data in cleartext in a communication channel that can be sniffed by unauthorized actors.
 + Extended Description
 
 Many communication channels can be "sniffed" (monitored) by adversaries during data transmission. For example, in networking, packets can traverse many intermediary nodes from the source to the
 destination, whether across the internet, an internal network, the cloud, etc. Some actors might have privileged access to a network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router, but
 they might not be authorized to collect the underlying data. As a result, network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.

 Applicable communication channels are not limited to software products. Applicable channels include hardware-specific technologies such as internal hardware networks and external debug channels,
 supporting remote JTAG debugging. When mitigations are not applied to combat adversaries within the product's threat model, this weakness significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation by such
 adversaries.

 When full communications are recorded or logged, such as with a packet dump, an adversary could attempt to obtain the dump long after the transmission has occurred and try to "sniff" the cleartext
 from the recorded communications in the dump itself. Even if the information is encoded in a way that is not human-readable, certain techniques could determine which encoding is being used, then
 decode the information.

 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.
       Scope                                                                                     Impact                                                                                 Likelihood
 Integrity          Technical Impact: Read Application Data; Modify Files or Directories
 Confidentiality
                    Anyone can read the information by gaining access to the channel being used for communication.
 + Likelihood Of Exploit
 High
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 The following code attempts to establish a connection to a site to communicate sensitive information.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 try {
 URL u = new URL("http://www.secret.example.org/");
 HttpURLConnection hu = (HttpURLConnection) u.openConnection();
 hu.setRequestMethod("PUT");
 hu.connect();
 OutputStream os = hu.getOutputStream();
 hu.disconnect();
 }
 catch (IOException e) {
 //...
 }

 Though a connection is successfully made, the connection is unencrypted and it is possible that all sensitive data sent to or received from the server will be read by unintended actors.

 Example 2

 In 2022, the OT:ICEFALL study examined products by 10 different Operational Technology (OT) vendors. The researchers reported 56 vulnerabilities and said that the products were "insecure by design" [
 REF-1283]. If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed. Since
 these products were often used in industries such as power, electrical, water, and others, there could even be safety implications.

 Multiple vendors used cleartext transmission of sensitive information in their OT products.

 Example 3

 A TAP accessible register is read/written by a JTAG based tool, for internal use by authorized users. However, an adversary can connect a probing device and collect the values from the unencrypted
 channel connecting the JTAG interface to the authorized user, if no additional protections are employed.

 Example 4

 The following Azure CLI command lists the properties of a particular storage account:

 (informative)
 Example Language: Shell 
 az storage account show -g {ResourceGroupName} -n {StorageAccountName}

 The JSON result might be:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: JSON 
 {
 "name": "{StorageAccountName}",
 "enableHttpsTrafficOnly": false,
 "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
 }

 The enableHttpsTrafficOnly value is set to false, because the default setting for Secure transfer is set to Disabled. This allows cloud storage resources to successfully connect and transfer data
 without the use of encryption (e.g., HTTP, SMB 2.1, SMB 3.0, etc.).

 Azure's storage accounts can be configured to only accept requests from secure connections made over HTTPS. The secure transfer setting can be enabled using Azure's Portal (GUI) or programmatically
 by setting the enableHttpsTrafficOnly property to True on the storage account, such as:

 (good code)
 Example Language: Shell 
 az storage account update -g {ResourceGroupName} -n {StorageAccountName} --https-only true

 The change can be confirmed from the result by verifying that the enableHttpsTrafficOnly value is true:

 (good code)
 Example Language: JSON 
 {
 "name": "{StorageAccountName}",
 "enableHttpsTrafficOnly": true,
 "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
 }

 Note: to enable secure transfer using Azure's Portal instead of the command line:

  1. Open the Create storage account pane in the Azure portal.
  2. In the Advanced page, select the Enable secure transfer checkbox.

 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Before transmitting, encrypt the data using reliable, confidentiality-protecting cryptographic protocols.
 Phase: Implementation

 When using web applications with SSL, use SSL for the entire session from login to logout, not just for the initial login page.
 Phase: Implementation

 When designing hardware platforms, ensure that approved encryption algorithms (such as those recommended by NIST) protect paths from security critical data to trusted user applications.
 Phase: Testing

 Use tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.
 These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.
 Phase: Operation

 Configure servers to use encrypted channels for communication, which may include SSL or other secure protocols.
 + Detection Methods
 Black Box

 Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the
 software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process;
 system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and
 sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.

 Attach the monitor to the process, trigger the feature that sends the data, and look for the presence or absence of common cryptographic functions in the call tree. Monitor the network and
 determine if the data packets contain readable commands. Tools exist for detecting if certain encodings are in use. If the traffic contains high entropy, this might indicate the usage of
 encryption.

 Automated Static Analysis

 Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without
 having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with
 "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.
 + Notes
 
 Maintenance

 The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping
 CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader
 ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.

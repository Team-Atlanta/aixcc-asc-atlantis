 CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information
 
 Weakness ID: 223
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Applicable Platforms

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.
       Scope                                                                                     Impact                                                                                 Likelihood
                    Technical Impact: Hide Activities
 Non-Repudiation
                    The source of an attack will be difficult or impossible to determine. This can allow attacks to the system to continue without notice.
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 This code logs suspicious multiple login attempts.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: PHP 
 function login($userName,$password){
 if(authenticate($userName,$password)){
 return True;
 }
 else{
 incrementLoginAttempts($userName);
 if(recentLoginAttempts($userName) > 5){
 writeLog("Failed login attempt by User: " . $userName . " at " + date('r') );
 }
 }
 }

 This code only logs failed login attempts when a certain limit is reached. If an attacker knows this limit, they can stop their attack from being discovered by avoiding the limit.

 Example 2

 This code prints the contents of a file if a user has permission.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: PHP 
 function readFile($filename){
 $user = getCurrentUser();
 $realFile = $filename;

 //resolve file if its a symbolic link
 if(is_link($filename)){
 $realFile = readlink($filename);
 }

 if(fileowner($realFile) == $user){
 echo file_get_contents($realFile);
 return;
 }
 else{
 echo 'Access denied';
 writeLog($user . ' attempted to access the file '. $filename . ' on '. date('r'));
 }
 }

 While the code logs a bad access attempt, it logs the user supplied name for the file, not the canonicalized file name. An attacker can obscure their target by giving the script the name of a link to
 the file they are attempting to access. Also note this code contains a race condition between the is_link() and readlink() functions (CWE-363).

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

 CWE-287: Improper Authentication
 
 Weakness ID: 287
 Vulnerability Mapping: DISCOURAGEDThis CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: ClassClass - a weakness that is described in a very abstract fashion, typically independent of any specific language or technology. More specific than a Pillar Weakness, but more general
 than a Base Weakness. Class level weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 1 or 2 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 When an actor claims to have a given identity, the product does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.
 + Alternate Terms
 authentification: An alternate term is "authentification", which appears to be most commonly used by people from non-English-speaking countries.
      AuthN:       "AuthN" is typically used as an abbreviation of "authentication" within the web application security community. It is also distinct from "AuthZ," which is an abbreviation of
                   "authorization." The use of "Auth" as an abbreviation is discouraged, since it could be used for either authentication or authorization.
      AuthC:       "AuthC" is used as an abbreviation of "authentication," but it appears to used less frequently than "AuthN."
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 The following code intends to ensure that the user is already logged in. If not, the code performs authentication with the user-provided username and password. If successful, it sets the loggedin and
 user cookies to "remember" that the user has already logged in. Finally, the code performs administrator tasks if the logged-in user has the "Administrator" username, as recorded in the user cookie.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Perl 
 my $q = new CGI;

 if ($q->cookie('loggedin') ne "true") {
 if (! AuthenticateUser($q->param('username'), $q->param('password'))) {
 ExitError("Error: you need to log in first");
 }
 else {
 # Set loggedin and user cookies.
 $q->cookie(
 -name => 'loggedin',
 -value => 'true'
 );

 $q->cookie(
 -name => 'user',
 -value => $q->param('username')
 );
 }
 }

 if ($q->cookie('user') eq "Administrator") {
 DoAdministratorTasks();
 }

 Unfortunately, this code can be bypassed. The attacker can set the cookies independently so that the code does not check the username and password. The attacker could do this with an HTTP request
 containing headers such as:

 (attack code)
  
 GET /cgi-bin/vulnerable.cgi HTTP/1.1
 Cookie: user=Administrator
 Cookie: loggedin=true

 [body of request]

 By setting the loggedin cookie to "true", the attacker bypasses the entire authentication check. By using the "Administrator" value in the user cookie, the attacker also gains privileges to
 administer the software.

 Example 2

 In January 2009, an attacker was able to gain administrator access to a Twitter server because the server did not restrict the number of login attempts [REF-236]. The attacker targeted a member of
 Twitter's support team and was able to successfully guess the member's password using a brute force attack by guessing a large number of common words. After gaining access as the member of the
 support staff, the attacker used the administrator panel to gain access to 33 accounts that belonged to celebrities and politicians. Ultimately, fake Twitter messages were sent that appeared to come
 from the compromised accounts.

 Example 3

 In 2022, the OT:ICEFALL study examined products by 10 different Operational Technology (OT) vendors. The researchers reported 56 vulnerabilities and said that the products were "insecure by design" [
 REF-1283]. If exploited, these vulnerabilities often allowed adversaries to change how the products operated, ranging from denial of service to changing the code that the products executed. Since
 these products were often used in industries such as power, electrical, water, and others, there could even be safety implications.

 Multiple vendors did not use any authentication or used client-side authentication for critical functionality in their OT products.

 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Strategy: Libraries or Frameworks

 Use an authentication framework or library such as the OWASP ESAPI Authentication feature.
 + Detection Methods
 Automated Static Analysis

 Automated static analysis is useful for detecting certain types of authentication. A tool may be able to analyze related configuration files, such as .htaccess in Apache web servers, or detect
 the usage of commonly-used authentication libraries.

 Generally, automated static analysis tools have difficulty detecting custom authentication schemes. In addition, the software's design may include some functionality that is accessible to any
 user and does not require an established identity; an automated technique that detects the absence of authentication may report false positives.

 Effectiveness: Limited

 Manual Static Analysis

 This weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record
 and modify an active session.

 Manual static analysis is useful for evaluating the correctness of custom authentication mechanisms.

 Effectiveness: High

 Note: These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: DISCOURAGED

 (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Frequent Misuse

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry might be misused when lower-level CWE entries are likely to be applicable. It is a level-1 Class (i.e., a child of a Pillar).
 Comments:

 Consider children or descendants, beginning with CWE-1390: Weak Authentication or CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function.
 Suggestions:
     CWE-ID                                                                                            Comment

 Relationship

 This can be resultant from SQL injection vulnerabilities and other issues.

 Maintenance

 The Taxonomy_Mappings to ISA/IEC 62443 were added in CWE 4.10, but they are still under review and might change in future CWE versions. These draft mappings were performed by members of the "Mapping
 CWE to 62443" subgroup of the CWE-CAPEC ICS/OT Special Interest Group (SIG), and their work is incomplete as of CWE 4.10. The mappings are included to facilitate discussion and review by the broader
 ICS/OT community, and they are likely to change in future CWE versions.

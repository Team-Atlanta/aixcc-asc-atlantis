 CWE-454: External Initialization of Trusted Variables or Data Stores
 
 Weakness ID: 454
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product initializes critical internal variables or data stores using inputs that can be modified by untrusted actors.
 + Extended Description
 A product system should be reluctant to trust variables that have been initialized outside of its trust boundary, especially if they are initialized by users. The variables may have been initialized
 incorrectly. If an attacker can initialize the variable, then they can influence what the vulnerable system will do.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Applicable Platforms
 Section HelpThis listing shows possible areas for which the given weakness could appear. These may be for specific named Languages, Operating Systems, Architectures, Paradigms, Technologies, or a
 class of such platforms. The platform is listed along with how frequently the given weakness appears for that instance.

 Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.
       Scope                                                                                     Impact                                                                                 Likelihood
                    Technical Impact: Modify Application Data
 Integrity
                    An attacker could gain access to and modify sensitive data or system information.
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 In the Java example below, a system property controls the debug level of the application.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 int debugLevel = Integer.getInteger("com.domain.application.debugLevel").intValue();

 If an attacker is able to modify the system property, then it may be possible to coax the application into divulging sensitive information by virtue of the fact that additional debug information is
 printed/exposed as the debug level increases.

 Example 2

 This code checks the HTTP POST request for a debug switch, and enables a debug mode if the switch is set.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: PHP 
 $debugEnabled = false;
 if ($_POST["debug"] == "true"){
 $debugEnabled = true;
 }
 /.../

 function login($username, $password){
 if($debugEnabled){
 echo 'Debug Activated';
 phpinfo();
 $isAdmin = True;
 return True;
 }
 }

 Any user can activate the debug mode, gaining administrator privileges. An attacker may also use the information printed by the phpinfo() function to further exploit the system. .

 This example also exhibits Information Exposure Through Debug Information (CWE-215)

 CVE-2000-0959           Does not clear dangerous environment variables, enabling symlink attack.
 CVE-2001-0033           Specify alternate configuration directory in environment variable, enabling untrusted path.
 CVE-2001-0872           Dangerous environment variable not cleansed.
 CVE-2001-0084           Specify arbitrary modules using environment variable.
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Implementation

 Strategy: Input Validation

 A product system should be reluctant to trust variables that have been initialized outside of its trust boundary. Ensure adequate checking (e.g. input validation) is performed when relying on
 input from outside a trust boundary.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Avoid any external control of variables. If necessary, restrict the variables that can be modified using an allowlist, and use a different namespace or naming convention if possible.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.
 + Notes
 
 Relationship

 Overlaps Missing variable initialization, especially in PHP.

 Applicable Platform

 This is often found in PHP due to register_globals and the common practice of storing library/include files under the web document root so that they are available using a direct request.

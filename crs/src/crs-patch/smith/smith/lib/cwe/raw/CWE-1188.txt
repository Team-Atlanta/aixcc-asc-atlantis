 CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default
 
 Weakness ID: 1188
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product initializes or sets a resource with a default that is intended to be changed by the administrator, but the default is not secure.
 + Extended Description
 
 Developers often choose default values that leave the product as open and easy to use as possible out-of-the-box, under the assumption that the administrator can (or should) change the default value.
 However, this ease-of-use comes at a cost when the default is insecure and the administrator does not change it.

 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

Initialization
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 This code attempts to login a user using credentials from a POST request:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: PHP 

 // $user and $pass automatically set from POST request
 if (login_user($user,$pass)) {
 $authorized = true;
 }
 ...

 if ($authorized) {
 generatePage();
 }

 Because the $authorized variable is never initialized, PHP will automatically set $authorized to any value included in the POST request if register_globals is enabled. An attacker can send a POST
 request with an unexpected third value 'authorized' set to 'true' and gain authorized status without supplying valid credentials.

 Here is a fixed version:

 (good code)
 Example Language: PHP 
 $user = $_POST['user'];
 $pass = $_POST['pass'];
 $authorized = false;
 if (login_user($user,$pass)) {
 $authorized = true;
 }
 ...

 This code avoids the issue by initializing the $authorized variable to false and explicitly retrieving the login credentials from the $_POST variable. Regardless, register_globals should never be
 enabled and is disabled by default in current versions of PHP.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.
 + Notes
 
 Maintenance

 This entry improves organization of concepts under initialization. The typical CWE model is to cover "Missing" and "Incorrect" behaviors. Arguably, this entry could be named as "Incorrect" instead of
 "Insecure." This might be changed in the near future.

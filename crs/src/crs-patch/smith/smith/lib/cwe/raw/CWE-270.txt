 CWE-270: Privilege Context Switching Error
 
 Weakness ID: 270
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product does not properly manage privileges while it is switching between different contexts that have different privileges or spheres of control.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

                    Technical Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
 Access Control
                    A user can assume the identity of another user with separate privileges in another context. This will give the user unauthorized access that may allow them to
                    acquire the access information of other users.

 CVE-2003-1026           Web browser cross domain problem when user hits "back" button.
 CVE-2002-1770           Cross-domain issue - third party product passes code to web browser, which executes it in unsafe zone.
 CVE-2005-2263           Run callback in different security context after it has been changed from untrusted to trusted. * note that "context switch before actions are completed" is one type of
                         problem that happens frequently, espec. in browsers.
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phases: Architecture and Design; Operation

 Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.
 Phases: Architecture and Design; Operation

 Strategy: Environment Hardening

 Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a
 single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as
 the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Strategy: Separation of Privilege

 Consider following the principle of separation of privilege. Require multiple conditions to be met before permitting access to a system resource.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

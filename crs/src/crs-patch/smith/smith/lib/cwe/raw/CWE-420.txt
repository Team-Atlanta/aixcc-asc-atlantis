 CWE-420: Unprotected Alternate Channel
 
 Weakness ID: 420
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product protects a primary channel, but it does not use the same level of protection for an alternate channel.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

 Access Control     Technical Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity; Bypass Protection Mechanism

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 Register SECURE_ME is located at address 0xF00. A mirror of this register called COPY_OF_SECURE_ME is at location 0x800F00. The register SECURE_ME is protected from malicious agents and only allows
 access to select, while COPY_OF_SECURE_ME is not.

 Access control is implemented using an allowlist (as indicated by acl_oh_allowlist). The identity of the initiator of the transaction is indicated by the one hot input, incoming_id. This is checked
 against the acl_oh_allowlist (which contains a list of initiators that are allowed to access the asset).

 Though this example is shown in Verilog, it will apply to VHDL as well.

 (informative)
 Example Language: Verilog 
 module foo_bar(data_out, data_in, incoming_id, address, clk, rst_n);
 output [31:0] data_out;
 input [31:0] data_in, incoming_id, address;
 input clk, rst_n;
 wire write_auth, addr_auth;
 reg [31:0] data_out, acl_oh_allowlist, q;
 assign write_auth = | (incoming_id & acl_oh_allowlist) ? 1 : 0;
 always @*
 acl_oh_allowlist <= 32'h8312;
 assign addr_auth = (address == 32'hF00) ? 1: 0;
 always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst_n)
 if (!rst_n)
 begin
 q <= 32'h0;
 data_out <= 32'h0;
 end
 else
 begin
 q <= (addr_auth & write_auth) ? data_in: q;
 data_out <= q;
 end
 end
 endmodule
 (bad code)
 Example Language: Verilog 
 assign addr_auth = (address == 32'hF00) ? 1: 0;

 The bugged line of code is repeated in the Bad example above. The weakness arises from the fact that the SECURE_ME register can be modified by writing to the shadow register COPY_OF_SECURE_ME. The
 address of COPY_OF_SECURE_ME should also be included in the check. That buggy line of code should instead be replaced as shown in the Good Code Snippet below.

 (good code)
 Example Language: Verilog 
 assign addr_auth = (address == 32'hF00 || address == 32'h800F00) ? 1: 0;

 CVE-2020-8004           When the internal flash is protected by blocking access on the Data Bus (DBUS), it can still be indirectly accessed through the Instruction Bus (IBUS).
 CVE-2002-0567           DB server assumes that local clients have performed authentication, allowing attacker to directly connect to a process to load libraries and execute commands; a socket
                         interface also exists (another alternate channel), so attack can be remote.
 CVE-2002-1578           Product does not restrict access to underlying database, so attacker can bypass restrictions by directly querying the database.
 CVE-2003-1035           User can avoid lockouts by using an API instead of the GUI to conduct brute force password guessing.
 CVE-2002-1863           FTP service can not be disabled even when other access controls would require it.
 CVE-2002-0066           Windows named pipe created without authentication/access control, allowing configuration modification.
 CVE-2004-1461           Router management interface spawns a separate TCP connection after authentication, allowing hijacking by attacker coming from the same IP address.
 + Potential Mitigations

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

 CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
 
 Weakness ID: 295
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product does not validate, or incorrectly validates, a certificate.
 + Extended Description
 When a certificate is invalid or malicious, it might allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the host and client. The product might connect to a
 malicious host while believing it is a trusted host, or the product might be deceived into accepting spoofed data that appears to originate from a trusted host.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Background Details
 A certificate is a token that associates an identity (principal) to a cryptographic key. Certificates can be used to check if a public key belongs to the assumed owner.
 + Modes Of Introduction
 Section HelpThe different Modes of Introduction provide information about how and when this weakness may be introduced. The Phase identifies a point in the life cycle at which introduction may occur,
 while the Note provides a typical scenario related to introduction during the given phase.
          Phase                                                                                             Note
 Architecture and Design
 Implementation          REALIZATION: This weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic.
 Implementation          When the product uses certificate pinning, the developer might not properly validate all relevant components of the certificate before pinning the certificate. This can
                         make it difficult or expensive to test after the pinning is complete.
 + Applicable Platforms
 Section HelpThis listing shows possible areas for which the given weakness could appear. These may be for specific named Languages, Operating Systems, Architectures, Paradigms, Technologies, or a
 class of such platforms. The platform is listed along with how frequently the given weakness appears for that instance.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 This code checks the certificate of a connected peer.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 if ((cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) && host)
 foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);

 if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN==foo))

 // certificate looks good, host can be trusted

 In this case, because the certificate is self-signed, there was no external authority that could prove the identity of the host. The program could be communicating with a different system that is
 spoofing the host, e.g. by poisoning the DNS cache or using an Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack to modify the traffic from server to client.

 Example 2

 The following OpenSSL code obtains a certificate and verifies it.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl);
 if (cert && (SSL_get_verify_result(ssl)==X509_V_OK)) {

 // do secret things
 }

 Even though the "verify" step returns X509_V_OK, this step does not include checking the Common Name against the name of the host. That is, there is no guarantee that the certificate is for the
 desired host. The SSL connection could have been established with a malicious host that provided a valid certificate.

 Example 3

 The following OpenSSL code ensures that there is a certificate and allows the use of expired certificates.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 if (cert = SSL_get_peer(certificate(ssl)) {
 foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);
 if ((X509_V_OK==foo) || (X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED==foo))

 //do stuff

 If the call to SSL_get_verify_result() returns X509_V_ERR_CERT_HAS_EXPIRED, this means that the certificate has expired. As time goes on, there is an increasing chance for attackers to compromise the
 certificate.

 Example 4

 The following OpenSSL code ensures that there is a certificate before continuing execution.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {

 // got a certificate, do secret things

 Because this code does not use SSL_get_verify_results() to check the certificate, it could accept certificates that have been revoked (X509_V_ERR_CERT_REVOKED). The software could be communicating
 with a malicious host.

 Example 5

 The following OpenSSL code ensures that the host has a certificate.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 if (cert = SSL_get_peer_certificate(ssl)) {

 // got certificate, host can be trusted

 //foo=SSL_get_verify_result(ssl);

 //if (X509_V_OK==foo) ...
 }

 Note that the code does not call SSL_get_verify_result(ssl), which effectively disables the validation step that checks the certificate.

 + Potential Mitigations
 Phases: Architecture and Design; Implementation

 Certificates should be carefully managed and checked to assure that data are encrypted with the intended owner's public key.
 Phase: Implementation

 If certificate pinning is being used, ensure that all relevant properties of the certificate are fully validated before the certificate is pinned, including the hostname.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

 CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
 
 Weakness ID: 681
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 When converting from one data type to another, such as long to integer, data can be omitted or translated in a way that produces unexpected values. If the resulting values are used in a sensitive
 context, then dangerous behaviors may occur.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 In the following Java example, a float literal is cast to an integer, thus causing a loss of precision.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 int i = (int) 33457.8f;

 Example 2

 This code adds a float and an integer together, casting the result to an integer.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: PHP 
 $floatVal = 1.8345;
 $intVal = 3;
 $result = (int)$floatVal + $intVal;

 Normally, PHP will preserve the precision of this operation, making $result = 4.8345. After the cast to int, it is reasonable to expect PHP to follow rounding convention and set $result = 5. However,
 the explicit cast to int always rounds DOWN, so the final value of $result is 4. This behavior may have unintended consequences.

 Example 3

 In this example the variable amount can hold a negative value when it is returned. Because the function is declared to return an unsigned int, amount will be implicitly converted to unsigned.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 unsigned int readdata () {
 int amount = 0;
 ...
 if (result == ERROR)
 amount = -1;
 ...
 return amount;
 }

 If the error condition in the code above is met, then the return value of readdata() will be 4,294,967,295 on a system that uses 32-bit integers.

 Example 4

 In this example, depending on the return value of accecssmainframe(), the variable amount can hold a negative value when it is returned. Because the function is declared to return an unsigned value,
 amount will be implicitly cast to an unsigned number.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 unsigned int readdata () {
 int amount = 0;
 ...
 amount = accessmainframe();
 ...
 return amount;
 }

 If the return value of accessmainframe() is -1, then the return value of readdata() will be 4,294,967,295 on a system that uses 32-bit integers.

 CVE-2022-2639           Chain: integer coercion error (CWE-192) prevents a return value from indicating an error, leading to out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
 CVE-2021-43537          Chain: in a web browser, an unsigned 64-bit integer is forcibly cast to a 32-bit integer (CWE-681) and potentially leading to an integer overflow (CWE-190). If an integer
                         overflow occurs, this can cause heap memory corruption (CWE-122)
 CVE-2007-4268           Chain: integer signedness error (CWE-195) passes signed comparison, leading to heap overflow (CWE-122)
 CVE-2007-4988           Chain: signed short width value in image processor is sign extended during conversion to unsigned int, which leads to integer overflow and heap-based buffer overflow.
 CVE-2009-0231           Integer truncation of length value leads to heap-based buffer overflow.
 CVE-2008-3282           Size of a particular type changes for 64-bit platforms, leading to an integer truncation in document processor causes incorrect index to be generated.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

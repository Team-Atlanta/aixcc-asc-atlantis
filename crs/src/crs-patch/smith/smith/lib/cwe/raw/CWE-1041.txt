 CWE-1041: Use of Redundant Code
 
 Weakness ID: 1041
 Vulnerability Mapping: PROHIBITEDThis CWE ID must not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product has multiple functions, methods, procedures, macros, etc. that contain the same code.
 + Extended Description
 
 This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the product, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. For example, if there
 are two copies of the same code, the programmer might fix a weakness in one copy while forgetting to fix the same weakness in another copy.

 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Applicable Platforms
 Section HelpThis listing shows possible areas for which the given weakness could appear. These may be for specific named Languages, Operating Systems, Architectures, Paradigms, Technologies, or a
 class of such platforms. The platform is listed along with how frequently the given weakness appears for that instance.

 Languages

 Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.
       Scope                                                                                     Impact                                                                                 Likelihood
 Other              Technical Impact: Reduce Maintainability

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 In the following Java example the code performs some complex math when specific test conditions are met. The math is the same in each case and the equations are repeated within the code.
 Unfortunately if a future change needs to be made then that change needs to be made in all locations. This opens the door to mistakes being made and the changes not being made in the same way in each
 instance.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 public class Main {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 double s = 10.0;
 double r = 1.0;
 double pi = 3.14159;
 double surface_area;

 if(r > 0.0) {
 // complex math equations
 surface_area = pi * r * s + pi * Math.pow(r, 2);

 }

 if(r > 1.0) {
 // a complex set of math
 surface_area = pi * r * s + pi * Math.pow(r, 2);

 }

 }


 }

 It is recommended to place the complex math into its own function and then call that function whenever necessary.

 (good code)
 Example Language: Java 
 public class Main {
 private double ComplexMath(double r, double s) {
 //complex math equations
 double pi = Math.PI;
 double surface_area = pi * r * s + pi * Math.pow(r, 2);
 return surface_area;

 }

 public static void main(String[] args) {
 double s = 10.0;
 double r = 1.0;
 double surface_area;

 if(r > 0.0) {
 surface_area = ComplexMath(r, s);

 }

 if(r > 1.0) {
 surface_area = ComplexMath(r, s);

 }

 }


 }
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Implementation

 Merge common functionality into a single function and then call that function from across the entire code base.
 + Weakness Ordinalities

 fits within the context of external information sources.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: PROHIBITED

 (this CWE ID must not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Other

 Rationale:

 This entry is primarily a quality issue with no direct security implications.
 Comments:

 Look for weaknesses that are focused specifically on insecure behaviors that have more direct security implications.

 CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management
 
 Weakness ID: 269
 Vulnerability Mapping: DISCOURAGEDThis CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: ClassClass - a weakness that is described in a very abstract fashion, typically independent of any specific language or technology. More specific than a Pillar Weakness, but more general
 than a Base Weakness. Class level weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 1 or 2 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

 + Likelihood Of Exploit

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 This code temporarily raises the program's privileges to allow creation of a new user folder.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Python 
 def makeNewUserDir(username):
 if invalidUsername(username):

 #avoid CWE-22 and CWE-78
 print('Usernames cannot contain invalid characters')
 return False

 try:
 raisePrivileges()
 os.mkdir('/home/' + username)
 lowerPrivileges()

 except OSError:
 print('Unable to create new user directory for user:' + username)
 return False

 return True

 While the program only raises its privilege level to create the folder and immediately lowers it again, if the call to os.mkdir() throws an exception, the call to lowerPrivileges() will not occur. As
 a result, the program is indefinitely operating in a raised privilege state, possibly allowing further exploitation to occur.

 Example 2

 The following example demonstrates the weakness.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 seteuid(0);
 /* do some stuff */

 seteuid(getuid());

 Example 3

 The following example demonstrates the weakness.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction() {
 public Object run() {
 // privileged code goes here, for example:
 System.loadLibrary("awt");
 return null;
 // nothing to return
 }

 Example 4

 This code intends to allow only Administrators to print debug information about a system.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 public enum Roles {
 ADMIN,USER,GUEST
 }

 public void printDebugInfo(User requestingUser){
 if(isAuthenticated(requestingUser)){
 switch(requestingUser.role){
 case GUEST:
 System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");
 break;

 default:
 System.out.println(currentDebugState());
 break;
 }
 }
 else{
 System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");
 }
 }

 While the intention was to only allow Administrators to print the debug information, the code as written only excludes those with the role of "GUEST". Someone with the role of "ADMIN" or "USER" will
 be allowed access, which goes against the original intent. An attacker may be able to use this debug information to craft an attack on the system.

 Example 5

 This code allows someone with the role of "ADMIN" or "OPERATOR" to reset a user's password. The role of "OPERATOR" is intended to have less privileges than an "ADMIN", but still be able to help users
 with small issues such as forgotten passwords.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 public enum Roles {
 ADMIN,OPERATOR,USER,GUEST
 }

 public void resetPassword(User requestingUser, User user, String password ){
 if(isAuthenticated(requestingUser)){
 switch(requestingUser.role){
 case GUEST:
 System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");
 break;

 case USER:
 System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");
 break;

 default:
 setPassword(user,password);
 break;
 }
 }

 else{
 System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");
 }
 }

 This code does not check the role of the user whose password is being reset. It is possible for an Operator to gain Admin privileges by resetting the password of an Admin account and taking control
 of that account.

 CVE-2001-1555           Terminal privileges are not reset when a user logs out.
 CVE-2001-1514           Does not properly pass security context to child processes in certain cases, allows privilege escalation.
 CVE-2001-0128           Does not properly compute roles.
 CVE-1999-1193           untrusted user placed in unix "wheel" group
 CVE-2005-2741           Product allows users to grant themselves certain rights that can be used to escalate privileges.
 CVE-2005-2496           Product uses group ID of a user instead of the group, causing it to run with different privileges. This is resultant from some other unknown issue.
 CVE-2004-0274           Product mistakenly assigns a particular status to an entity, leading to increased privileges.
 CVE-2007-4217           FTP client program on a certain OS runs with setuid privileges and has a buffer overflow. Most clients do not need extra privileges, so an overflow is not a vulnerability
                         for those clients.
 CVE-2007-5159           OS incorrectly installs a program with setuid privileges, allowing users to gain privileges.
 CVE-2008-4638           Composite: application running with high privileges (CWE-250) allows user to specify a restricted file to process, which generates a parsing error that leaks the contents
                         of the file (CWE-209).
 CVE-2007-3931           Installation script installs some programs as setuid when they shouldn't be.
 CVE-2002-1981           Roles have access to dangerous procedures (Accessible entities).
 CVE-2002-1671           Untrusted object/method gets access to clipboard (Accessible entities).
 CVE-2000-0315           Traceroute program allows unprivileged users to modify source address of packet (Accessible entities).
 CVE-2000-0506           User with capability can prevent setuid program from dropping privileges (Unsafe privileged actions).
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phases: Architecture and Design; Operation

 Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Strategy: Separation of Privilege

 Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to entities in a software system.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Strategy: Separation of Privilege

 Consider following the principle of separation of privilege. Require multiple conditions to be met before permitting access to a system resource.

 + Detection Methods
 Automated Static Analysis

 Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without
 having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with
 "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: DISCOURAGED

 (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Frequent Misuse

 Rationale:

 CWE-269 is commonly misused. It can be conflated with "privilege escalation," which is a technical impact that is listed in many low-information vulnerability reports [REF-1287]. It is not useful
 for trend analysis.
 Comments:

 If an error or mistake allows privilege escalation, then use the CWE ID for that mistake. Avoid using CWE-269 when only phrases such as "privilege escalation" or "gain privileges" are available,
 as these indicate technical impact of the vulnerability - not the root cause weakness. If the root cause seems to be directly related to privileges, then examine the children of CWE-269 for
 additional hints, such as Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250) or Incorrect Privilege Assignment (CWE-266).
 + Notes
 
 Maintenance

 The relationships between privileges, permissions, and actors (e.g. users and groups) need further refinement within the Research view. One complication is that these concepts apply to two different
 pillars, related to control of resources (CWE-664) and protection mechanism failures (CWE-693).

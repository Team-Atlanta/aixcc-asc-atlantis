 CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password
 
 Weakness ID: 640
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities in limited situations requiring careful review (with careful review of mapping notes)
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.

 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers.

 + Description
 The product contains a mechanism for users to recover or change their passwords without knowing the original password, but the mechanism is weak.
 + Extended Description
 
 It is common for an application to have a mechanism that provides a means for a user to gain access to their account in the event they forget their password. Very often the password recovery
 mechanism is weak, which has the effect of making it more likely that it would be possible for a person other than the legitimate system user to gain access to that user's account. Weak password
 recovery schemes completely undermine a strong password authentication scheme.

 This weakness may be that the security question is too easy to guess or find an answer to (e.g. because the question is too common, or the answers can be found using social media). Or there might be
 an implementation weakness in the password recovery mechanism code that may for instance trick the system into e-mailing the new password to an e-mail account other than that of the user. There might
 be no throttling done on the rate of password resets so that a legitimate user can be denied service by an attacker if an attacker tries to recover their password in a rapid succession. The system
 may send the original password to the user rather than generating a new temporary password. In summary, password recovery functionality, if not carefully designed and implemented can often become the
 system's weakest link that can be misused in a way that would allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

                    Technical Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
 Access Control
                    An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the system by retrieving legitimate user's authentication credentials.
                    Technical Impact: DoS: Resource Consumption (Other)
 Availability
                    An attacker could deny service to legitimate system users by launching a brute force attack on the password recovery mechanism using user ids of legitimate
                    users.
 Integrity          Technical Impact: Other
 Other
                    The system's security functionality is turned against the system by the attacker.
 + Likelihood Of Exploit
 High
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 A famous example of this type of weakness being exploited is the eBay attack. eBay always displays the user id of the highest bidder. In the final minutes of the auction, one of the bidders could try
 to log in as the highest bidder three times. After three incorrect log in attempts, eBay password throttling would kick in and lock out the highest bidder's account for some time. An attacker could
 then make their own bid and their victim would not have a chance to place the counter bid because they would be locked out. Thus an attacker could win the auction.

 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Make sure that all input supplied by the user to the password recovery mechanism is thoroughly filtered and validated.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Do not use standard weak security questions and use several security questions.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Make sure that there is throttling on the number of incorrect answers to a security question. Disable the password recovery functionality after a certain (small) number of incorrect guesses.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Require that the user properly answers the security question prior to resetting their password and sending the new password to the e-mail address of record.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Never allow the user to control what e-mail address the new password will be sent to in the password recovery mechanism.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Assign a new temporary password rather than revealing the original password.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities in limited situations requiring careful review)
 Reason: Frequent Misuse

 Rationale:

 This entry appears to be frequently misused for any weakness related to password changes, even though the name focuses on "Password Recovery" for a "forgotten" password.
 Comments:

 CWE-640 should only be used when there is a "password recovery" mechanism for forgotten passwords. Consider password-related entries under CWE-1390: Weak Authentication.
 + Notes
 
 Maintenance

 This entry might be reclassified as a category or "loose composite," since it lists multiple specific errors that can make the mechanism weak. However, under view 1000, it could be a weakness under
 protection mechanism failure, although it is different from most PMF issues since it is related to a feature that is designed to bypass a protection mechanism (specifically, the lack of knowledge of
 a password).

 Maintenance

 This entry probably needs to be split; see extended description.

 CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')
 
 Weakness ID: 77
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities in limited situations requiring careful review (with careful review of mapping notes)
 Abstraction: ClassClass - a weakness that is described in a very abstract fashion, typically independent of any specific language or technology. More specific than a Pillar Weakness, but more general
 than a Base Weakness. Class level weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 1 or 2 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product constructs all or part of a command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify
 the intended command when it is sent to a downstream component.
 + Extended Description
 
 Command injection vulnerabilities typically occur when:

 1. Data enters the application from an untrusted source.
 2. The data is part of a string that is executed as a command by the application.
 3. By executing the command, the application gives an attacker a privilege or capability that the attacker would not otherwise have.

 Many protocols and products have their own custom command language. While OS or shell command strings are frequently discovered and targeted, developers may not realize that these other command
 languages might also be vulnerable to attacks.

 Command injection is a common problem with wrapper programs.

 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

 Integrity          Technical Impact: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands
 Confidentiality
 Availability       If a malicious user injects a character (such as a semi-colon) that delimits the end of one command and the beginning of another, it may be possible to then
                    insert an entirely new and unrelated command that was not intended to be executed.

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 The following simple program accepts a filename as a command line argument and displays the contents of the file back to the user. The program is installed setuid root because it is intended for use
 as a learning tool to allow system administrators in-training to inspect privileged system files without giving them the ability to modify them or damage the system.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 int main(int argc, char** argv) {
 char cmd[CMD_MAX] = "/usr/bin/cat ";
 strcat(cmd, argv[1]);
 system(cmd);
 }

 Because the program runs with root privileges, the call to system() also executes with root privileges. If a user specifies a standard filename, the call works as expected. However, if an attacker
 passes a string of the form ";rm -rf /", then the call to system() fails to execute cat due to a lack of arguments and then plows on to recursively delete the contents of the root partition.

 Note that if argv[1] is a very long argument, then this issue might also be subject to a buffer overflow (CWE-120).

 Example 2

 The following code is from an administrative web application designed to allow users to kick off a backup of an Oracle database using a batch-file wrapper around the rman utility and then run a
 cleanup.bat script to delete some temporary files. The script rmanDB.bat accepts a single command line parameter, which specifies what type of backup to perform. Because access to the database is
 restricted, the application runs the backup as a privileged user.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 ...
 String btype = request.getParameter("backuptype");
 String cmd = new String("cmd.exe /K \"
 c:\\util\\rmanDB.bat "
 +btype+
 "&&c:\\utl\\cleanup.bat\"")

 System.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);
 ...

 The problem here is that the program does not do any validation on the backuptype parameter read from the user. Typically the Runtime.exec() function will not execute multiple commands, but in this
 case the program first runs the cmd.exe shell in order to run multiple commands with a single call to Runtime.exec(). Once the shell is invoked, it will happily execute multiple commands separated by
 two ampersands. If an attacker passes a string of the form "& del c:\\dbms\\*.*", then the application will execute this command along with the others specified by the program. Because of the nature
 of the application, it runs with the privileges necessary to interact with the database, which means whatever command the attacker injects will run with those privileges as well.

 Example 3

 The following code from a system utility uses the system property APPHOME to determine the directory in which it is installed and then executes an initialization script based on a relative path from
 the specified directory.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 ...
 String home = System.getProperty("APPHOME");
 String cmd = home + INITCMD;
 java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);
 ...

 The code above allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the elevated privilege of the application by modifying the system property APPHOME to point to a different path containing a
 malicious version of INITCMD. Because the program does not validate the value read from the environment, if an attacker can control the value of the system property APPHOME, then they can fool the
 application into running malicious code and take control of the system.

 The following code is a wrapper around the UNIX command cat which prints the contents of a file to standard out. It is also injectable:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 #include <stdio.h>
 #include <unistd.h>

 int main(int argc, char **argv) {

 char cat[] = "cat ";
 char *command;
 size_t commandLength;

 commandLength = strlen(cat) + strlen(argv[1]) + 1;
 command = (char *) malloc(commandLength);
 strncpy(command, cat, commandLength);
 strncat(command, argv[1], (commandLength - strlen(cat)) );

 system(command);
 return (0);
 }

 Used normally, the output is simply the contents of the file requested:

 (informative)
  
 $ ./catWrapper Story.txt
 When last we left our heroes...

 However, if we add a semicolon and another command to the end of this line, the command is executed by catWrapper with no complaint:

 (attack code)
  
 $ ./catWrapper Story.txt; ls
 When last we left our heroes...
 Story.txt
 SensitiveFile.txt
 PrivateData.db
 a.out*

 If catWrapper had been set to have a higher privilege level than the standard user, arbitrary commands could be executed with that higher privilege.

 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 If at all possible, use library calls rather than external processes to recreate the desired functionality.
 Phase: Implementation

 If possible, ensure that all external commands called from the program are statically created.
 Phase: Implementation

 Strategy: Input Validation

 Assume all input is malicious. Use an "accept known good" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not
 strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.

 When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency
 across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, "boat" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not
 valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as "red" or "blue."

 Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers
 enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.

 Phase: Operation

 Run time: Run time policy enforcement may be used in an allowlist fashion to prevent use of any non-sanctioned commands.
 Phase: System Configuration

 Assign permissions that prevent the user from accessing/opening privileged files.

 Primary    (where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 + Detection Methods
 Automated Static Analysis

 Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without
 having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with
 "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED-WITH-REVIEW

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities in limited situations requiring careful review)
 Reason: Frequent Misuse

 Rationale:

 CWE-77 is often misused when OS command injection (CWE-78) was intended instead [REF-1287].
 Comments:

 If the weakness involves a command language besides OS shell invocation, then CWE-77 could be used.
 + Notes
 
 Terminology

 The "command injection" phrase carries different meanings to different people. For some people, it refers to any type of attack that can allow the attacker to execute commands of their own choosing,
 regardless of how those commands are inserted. The command injection could thus be resultant from another weakness. This usage also includes cases in which the functionality allows the user to
 specify an entire command, which is then executed; within CWE, this situation might be better regarded as an authorization problem (since an attacker should not be able to specify arbitrary
 commands.)

 Another common usage, which includes CWE-77 and its descendants, involves cases in which the attacker injects separators into the command being constructed.

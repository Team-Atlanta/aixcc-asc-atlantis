 CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
 
 Weakness ID: 119
 Vulnerability Mapping: DISCOURAGEDThis CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: ClassClass - a weakness that is described in a very abstract fashion, typically independent of any specific language or technology. More specific than a Pillar Weakness, but more general
 than a Base Weakness. Class level weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 1 or 2 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.
 + Extended Description
 
 Certain languages allow direct addressing of memory locations and do not automatically ensure that these locations are valid for the memory buffer that is being referenced. This can cause read or
 write operations to be performed on memory locations that may be associated with other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

 As a result, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code, alter the intended control flow, read sensitive information, or cause the system to crash.

 + Alternate Terms
 Buffer Overflow: This term has many different meanings to different audiences. From a CWE mapping perspective, this term should be avoided where possible. Some researchers, developers, and tools
                  intend for it to mean "write past the end of a buffer," whereas others use the same term to mean "any read or write outside the boundaries of a buffer, whether before the
                  beginning of the buffer or after the end of the buffer." Still others using the same term could mean "any action after the end of a buffer, whether it is a read or write." Since
                  the term is commonly used for exploitation and for vulnerabilities, it further confuses things.
 buffer overrun:  Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer overrun," but most people use "buffer overflow." See the alternate term for "buffer overflow" for context.
  memory safety:  Generally used for techniques that avoid weaknesses related to memory access, such as those identified by CWE-119 and its descendants. However, the term is not formal, and there
                  is likely disagreement between practitioners as to which weaknesses are implicitly covered by the "memory safety" term.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

                    Technical Impact: Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands; Modify Memory

 Integrity          If the memory accessible by the attacker can be effectively controlled, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code, as with a standard buffer overflow. If the
 Confidentiality    attacker can overwrite a pointer's worth of memory (usually 32 or 64 bits), they can redirect a function pointer to their own malicious code. Even when the
 Availability       attacker can only modify a single byte arbitrary code execution can be possible. Sometimes this is because the same problem can be exploited repeatedly to the
                    same effect. Other times it is because the attacker can overwrite security-critical application-specific data -- such as a flag indicating whether the user is an
                    administrator.
                    Technical Impact: Read Memory; DoS: Crash, Exit, or Restart; DoS: Resource Consumption (CPU); DoS: Resource Consumption (Memory)
 Availability
 Confidentiality    Out of bounds memory access will very likely result in the corruption of relevant memory, and perhaps instructions, possibly leading to a crash. Other attacks
                    leading to lack of availability are possible, including putting the program into an infinite loop.
                    Technical Impact: Read Memory
 Confidentiality
                    In the case of an out-of-bounds read, the attacker may have access to sensitive information. If the sensitive information contains system details, such as the
                    current buffers position in memory, this knowledge can be used to craft further attacks, possibly with more severe consequences.

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 This example takes an IP address from a user, verifies that it is well formed and then looks up the hostname and copies it into a buffer.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 void host_lookup(char *user_supplied_addr){
 struct hostent *hp;
 in_addr_t *addr;
 char hostname[64];
 in_addr_t inet_addr(const char *cp);

 /*routine that ensures user_supplied_addr is in the right format for conversion */

 validate_addr_form(user_supplied_addr);
 addr = inet_addr(user_supplied_addr);
 hp = gethostbyaddr( addr, sizeof(struct in_addr), AF_INET);
 strcpy(hostname, hp->h_name);
 }

 This function allocates a buffer of 64 bytes to store the hostname, however there is no guarantee that the hostname will not be larger than 64 bytes. If an attacker specifies an address which
 resolves to a very large hostname, then the function may overwrite sensitive data or even relinquish control flow to the attacker.

 Note that this example also contains an unchecked return value (CWE-252) that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476).

 Example 2

 This example applies an encoding procedure to an input string and stores it into a buffer.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 char * copy_input(char *user_supplied_string){
 int i, dst_index;
 char *dst_buf = (char*)malloc(4*sizeof(char) * MAX_SIZE);
 if ( MAX_SIZE <= strlen(user_supplied_string) ){
 die("user string too long, die evil hacker!");
 }
 dst_index = 0;
 for ( i = 0; i < strlen(user_supplied_string); i++ ){
 if( '&' == user_supplied_string[i] ){
 dst_buf[dst_index++] = '&';
 dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'a';
 dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'm';
 dst_buf[dst_index++] = 'p';
 dst_buf[dst_index++] = ';';
 }
 else if ('<' == user_supplied_string[i] ){
 /* encode to &lt; */
 }
 else dst_buf[dst_index++] = user_supplied_string[i];
 }
 return dst_buf;
 }

 The programmer attempts to encode the ampersand character in the user-controlled string, however the length of the string is validated before the encoding procedure is applied. Furthermore, the
 programmer assumes encoding expansion will only expand a given character by a factor of 4, while the encoding of the ampersand expands by 5. As a result, when the encoding procedure expands the
 string it is possible to overflow the destination buffer if the attacker provides a string of many ampersands.

 Example 3

 The following example asks a user for an offset into an array to select an item.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 

 int main (int argc, char **argv) {
 char *items[] = {"boat", "car", "truck", "train"};
 int index = GetUntrustedOffset();
 printf("You selected %s\n", items[index-1]);
 }

 The programmer allows the user to specify which element in the list to select, however an attacker can provide an out-of-bounds offset, resulting in a buffer over-read (CWE-126).

 Example 4

 In the following code, the method retrieves a value from an array at a specific array index location that is given as an input parameter to the method

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 int getValueFromArray(int *array, int len, int index) {

 int value;

 // check that the array index is less than the maximum

 // length of the array
 if (index < len) {
 // get the value at the specified index of the array
 value = array[index];
 }
 // if array index is invalid then output error message
 // and return value indicating error
 else {
 printf("Value is: %d\n", array[index]);
 value = -1;
 }

 return value;
 }

 However, this method only verifies that the given array index is less than the maximum length of the array but does not check for the minimum value (CWE-839). This will allow a negative value to be
 accepted as the input array index, which will result in a out of bounds read (CWE-125) and may allow access to sensitive memory. The input array index should be checked to verify that is within the
 maximum and minimum range required for the array (CWE-129). In this example the if statement should be modified to include a minimum range check, as shown below.

 (good code)
 Example Language: C 

 ...

 // check that the array index is within the correct

 // range of values for the array
 if (index >= 0 && index < len) {

 ...

 Example 5

 Windows provides the _mbs family of functions to perform various operations on multibyte strings. When these functions are passed a malformed multibyte string, such as a string containing a valid
 leading byte followed by a single null byte, they can read or write past the end of the string buffer causing a buffer overflow. The following functions all pose a risk of buffer overflow: _mbsinc
 _mbsdec _mbsncat _mbsncpy _mbsnextc _mbsnset _mbsrev _mbsset _mbsstr _mbstok _mbccpy _mbslen

 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Requirements

 Strategy: Language Selection

 Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.

 For example, many languages that perform their own memory management, such as Java and Perl, are not subject to buffer overflows. Other languages, such as Ada and C#, typically provide overflow
 protection, but the protection can be disabled by the programmer.

 Be wary that a language's interface to native code may still be subject to overflows, even if the language itself is theoretically safe.

 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Strategy: Libraries or Frameworks

 Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.

 Examples include the Safe C String Library (SafeStr) by Messier and Viega [REF-57], and the Strsafe.h library from Microsoft [REF-56]. These libraries provide safer versions of overflow-prone
 string-handling functions.

 Note: This is not a complete solution, since many buffer overflows are not related to strings.
 Phases: Operation; Build and Compilation

 Strategy: Environment Hardening

 Use automatic buffer overflow detection mechanisms that are offered by certain compilers or compiler extensions. Examples include: the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag, Fedora/Red Hat
 FORTIFY_SOURCE GCC flag, StackGuard, and ProPolice, which provide various mechanisms including canary-based detection and range/index checking.

 D3-SFCV (Stack Frame Canary Validation) from D3FEND [REF-1334] discusses canary-based detection in detail.

 Effectiveness: Defense in Depth

 Note:

 This is not necessarily a complete solution, since these mechanisms only detect certain types of overflows. In addition, the result is still a denial of service, since the typical response is to
 exit the application.

 Phase: Implementation

 Consider adhering to the following rules when allocating and managing an application's memory:

   • Double check that the buffer is as large as specified.
   • When using functions that accept a number of bytes to copy, such as strncpy(), be aware that if the destination buffer size is equal to the source buffer size, it may not NULL-terminate the
     string.
   • Check buffer boundaries if accessing the buffer in a loop and make sure there is no danger of writing past the allocated space.
   • If necessary, truncate all input strings to a reasonable length before passing them to the copy and concatenation functions.

 Phases: Operation; Build and Compilation

 Strategy: Environment Hardening

 Run or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions of a program's executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it
 can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code.

 Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default
 memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as "rebasing" (for Windows) and "prelinking" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot
 be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking.

 For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335].

 Effectiveness: Defense in Depth

 Note: These techniques do not provide a complete solution. For instance, exploits frequently use a bug that discloses memory addresses in order to maximize reliability of code execution [REF-1337
 ]. It has also been shown that a side-channel attack can bypass ASLR [REF-1333]
 Phase: Operation

 Strategy: Environment Hardening

 Use a CPU and operating system that offers Data Execution Protection (using hardware NX or XD bits) or the equivalent techniques that simulate this feature in software, such as PaX [REF-60] [
 REF-61]. These techniques ensure that any instruction executed is exclusively at a memory address that is part of the code segment.

 For more information on these techniques see D3-PSEP (Process Segment Execution Prevention) from D3FEND [REF-1336].

 Effectiveness: Defense in Depth

 Note: This is not a complete solution, since buffer overflows could be used to overwrite nearby variables to modify the software's state in dangerous ways. In addition, it cannot be used in cases
 in which self-modifying code is required. Finally, an attack could still cause a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.
 Phase: Implementation

 Replace unbounded copy functions with analogous functions that support length arguments, such as strcpy with strncpy. Create these if they are not available.

 Effectiveness: Moderate

 Note: This approach is still susceptible to calculation errors, including issues such as off-by-one errors (CWE-193) and incorrectly calculating buffer lengths (CWE-131).
 + Detection Methods
 Automated Static Analysis

 This weakness can often be detected using automated static analysis tools. Many modern tools use data flow analysis or constraint-based techniques to minimize the number of false positives.

 Automated static analysis generally does not account for environmental considerations when reporting out-of-bounds memory operations. This can make it difficult for users to determine which
 warnings should be investigated first. For example, an analysis tool might report buffer overflows that originate from command line arguments in a program that is not expected to run with setuid
 or other special privileges.

 Effectiveness: High

 Note: Detection techniques for buffer-related errors are more mature than for most other weakness types.
 Automated Dynamic Analysis

 This weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness
 testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: DISCOURAGED

 (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Frequent Misuse

 Rationale:

 CWE-119 is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available.
 Comments:

 Look at CWE-119's children and consider mapping to CWEs such as CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write, CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read, or others.
 + Notes
 
 Applicable Platform

 It is possible in any programming languages without memory management support to attempt an operation outside of the bounds of a memory buffer, but the consequences will vary widely depending on the
 language, platform, and chip architecture.

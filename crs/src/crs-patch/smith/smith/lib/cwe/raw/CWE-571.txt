 CWE-571: Expression is Always True
 
 Weakness ID: 571
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers.

 Implementation
 + Applicable Platforms
 Section HelpThis listing shows possible areas for which the given weakness could appear. These may be for specific named Languages, Operating Systems, Architectures, Paradigms, Technologies, or a
 class of such platforms. The platform is listed along with how frequently the given weakness appears for that instance.

 Class: Not Language-Specific (Undetermined Prevalence)

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.
       Scope                                                                                     Impact                                                                                 Likelihood
 Other              Technical Impact: Quality Degradation; Varies by Context

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 In the following Java example the updateInventory() method used within an e-business product ordering/inventory application will check if the input product number is in the store or in the warehouse.
 If the product is found, the method will update the store or warehouse database as well as the aggregate product database. If the product is not found, the method intends to do some special
 processing without updating any database.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 

 public void updateInventory(String productNumber) {
 boolean isProductAvailable = false;
 boolean isDelayed = false;

 if (productInStore(productNumber)) {
 isProductAvailable = true;
 updateInStoreDatabase(productNumber);
 }
 else if (productInWarehouse(productNumber)) {
 isProductAvailable = true;
 updateInWarehouseDatabase(productNumber);
 }
 else {
 isProductAvailable = true;
 }

 if ( isProductAvailable ) {
 updateProductDatabase(productNumber);
 }
 else if ( isDelayed ) {

 /* Warn customer about delay before order processing */
 ...
 }
 }

 However, the method never sets the isDelayed variable and instead will always update the isProductAvailable variable to true. The result is that the predicate testing the isProductAvailable boolean
 will always evaluate to true and therefore always update the product database. Further, since the isDelayed variable is initialized to false and never changed, the expression always evaluates to
 false and the customer will never be warned of a delay on their product.

 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Testing

 Use Static Analysis tools to spot such conditions.
 + Detection Methods
 Automated Static Analysis

 Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without
 having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with
 "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Effectiveness: High

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

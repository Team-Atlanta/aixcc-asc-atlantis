 CWE-698: Execution After Redirect (EAR)
 
 Weakness ID: 698
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 while the Note provides a typical scenario related to introduction during the given phase.

 Implementation
 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.
       Scope                                                                                     Impact                                                                                 Likelihood
 Other              Technical Impact: Alter Execution Logic; Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands
 Confidentiality
 Integrity          This weakness could affect the control flow of the application and allow execution of untrusted code.
 Availability
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 This code queries a server and displays its status when a request comes from an authorized IP address.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: PHP 
 $requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
 if(!in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowList)){
 echo "You are not authorized to view this page";
 http_redirect($errorPageURL);
 }
 $status = getServerStatus();
 echo $status;
 ...

 This code redirects unauthorized users, but continues to execute code after calling http_redirect(). This means even unauthorized users may be able to access the contents of the page or perform a DoS
 attack on the server being queried. Also, note that this code is vulnerable to an IP address spoofing attack (CWE-212).

 CVE-2007-4932           Remote attackers can obtain access to administrator functionality through EAR.

 CVE-2007-2713           Chain: Execution after redirect triggers eval injection.
 CVE-2007-6652           chain: execution after redirect allows non-administrator to perform static code injection.

 Primary    (where the weakness exists independent of other weaknesses)
 + Detection Methods
 Black Box

 This issue might not be detected if testing is performed using a web browser, because the browser might obey the redirect and move the user to a different page before the application has produced
 outputs that indicate something is amiss.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

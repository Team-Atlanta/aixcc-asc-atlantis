 CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
 
 Weakness ID: 359
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers.

 + Description
 The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have
 the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected.
 + Extended Description
 
 There are many types of sensitive information that products must protect from attackers, including system data, communications, configuration, business secrets, intellectual property, and an
 individual's personal (private) information. Private personal information may include a password, phone number, geographic location, personal messages, credit card number, etc. Private information is
 important to consider whether the person is a user of the product, or part of a data set that is processed by the product. An exposure of private information does not necessarily prevent the product
 from working properly, and in fact the exposure might be intended by the developer, e.g. as part of data sharing with other organizations. However, the exposure of personal private information can
 still be undesirable or explicitly prohibited by law or regulation.

 Some types of private information include:

   • Government identifiers, such as Social Security Numbers
   • Contact information, such as home addresses and telephone numbers
   • Geographic location - where the user is (or was)
   • Employment history
   • Financial data - such as credit card numbers, salary, bank accounts, and debts
   • Pictures, video, or audio
   • Behavioral patterns - such as web surfing history, when certain activities are performed, etc.
   • Relationships (and types of relationships) with others - family, friends, contacts, etc.
   • Communications - e-mail addresses, private messages, text messages, chat logs, etc.
   • Health - medical conditions, insurance status, prescription records
   • Account passwords and other credentials

 Some of this information may be characterized as PII (Personally Identifiable Information), Protected Health Information (PHI), etc. Categories of private information may overlap or vary based on the
 intended usage or the policies and practices of a particular industry.

 Sometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no
 explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates identification numbers based on student social security numbers, then the
 identification numbers should be considered private.

 Confidentiality    Technical Impact: Read Application Data

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 The following code contains a logging statement that tracks the contents of records added to a database by storing them in a log file. Among other values that are stored, the getPassword() function
 returns the user-supplied plaintext password associated with the account.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C# 
 pass = GetPassword();
 ...
 dbmsLog.WriteLine(id + ":" + pass + ":" + type + ":" + tstamp);

 The code in the example above logs a plaintext password to the filesystem. Although many developers trust the filesystem as a safe storage location for data, it should not be trusted implicitly,
 particularly when privacy is a concern.

 Example 2

 This code uses location to determine the user's current US State location.

 First the application must declare that it requires the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission in the application's manifest.xml:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: XML 
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>

 During execution, a call to getLastLocation() will return a location based on the application's location permissions. In this case the application has permission for the most accurate location
 possible:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 locationClient = new LocationClient(this, this, this);
 locationClient.connect();
 Location userCurrLocation;
 userCurrLocation = locationClient.getLastLocation();
 deriveStateFromCoords(userCurrLocation);

 While the application needs this information, it does not need to use the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission, as the ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION permission will be sufficient to identify which US state the
 user is in.

 Example 3

 In 2004, an employee at AOL sold approximately 92 million private customer e-mail addresses to a spammer marketing an offshore gambling web site [REF-338]. In response to such high-profile exploits,
 the collection and management of private data is becoming increasingly regulated.

 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Requirements

 Identify and consult all relevant regulations for personal privacy. An organization may be required to comply with certain federal and state regulations, depending on its location, the type of
 business it conducts, and the nature of any private data it handles. Regulations may include Safe Harbor Privacy Framework [REF-340], Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLBA) [REF-341], Health Insurance
 Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [REF-342], General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [REF-1047], California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) [REF-1048], and others.

 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Carefully evaluate how secure design may interfere with privacy, and vice versa. Security and privacy concerns often seem to compete with each other. From a security perspective, all important
 operations should be recorded so that any anomalous activity can later be identified. However, when private data is involved, this practice can in fact create risk. Although there are many ways
 in which private data can be handled unsafely, a common risk stems from misplaced trust. Programmers often trust the operating environment in which a program runs, and therefore believe that it
 is acceptable store private information on the file system, in the registry, or in other locally-controlled resources. However, even if access to certain resources is restricted, this does not
 guarantee that the individuals who do have access can be trusted.

 + Detection Methods
 Architecture or Design Review

 Private personal data can enter a program in a variety of ways:

   • Directly from the user in the form of a password or personal information
   • Accessed from a database or other data store by the application
   • Indirectly from a partner or other third party

 If the data is written to an external location - such as the console, file system, or network - a privacy violation may occur.

 Effectiveness: High

 Automated Static Analysis

 Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without
 having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with
 "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Effectiveness: High

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.
 + Notes
 
 Maintenance

 This entry overlaps many other entries that are not organized around the kind of sensitive information that is exposed. However, because privacy is treated with such importance due to regulations and
 other factors, and it may be useful for weakness-finding tools to highlight capabilities that detect personal private information instead of system information, it is not clear whether - and how -
 this entry should be deprecated.

 CWE-204: Observable Response Discrepancy
 
 Weakness ID: 204
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor outside of the intended control sphere.
 + Extended Description
 This issue frequently occurs during authentication, where a difference in failed-login messages could allow an attacker to determine if the username is valid or not. These exposures can be
 inadvertent (bug) or intentional (design).
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.
       Scope                                                                                     Impact                                                                                 Likelihood

 Access Control
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 The following code checks validity of the supplied username and password and notifies the user of a successful or failed login.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Perl 
 my $username=param('username');
 my $password=param('password');

 if (IsValidUsername($username) == 1)
 {
 if (IsValidPassword($username, $password) == 1)
 {
 print "Login Successful";
 }
 else
 {
 print "Login Failed - incorrect password";
 }
 }
 else
 {
 print "Login Failed - unknown username";
 }

 In the above code, there are different messages for when an incorrect username is supplied, versus when the username is correct but the password is wrong. This difference enables a potential attacker
 to understand the state of the login function, and could allow an attacker to discover a valid username by trying different values until the incorrect password message is returned. In essence, this
 makes it easier for an attacker to obtain half of the necessary authentication credentials.

 While this type of information may be helpful to a user, it is also useful to a potential attacker. In the above example, the message for both failed cases should be the same, such as:

 (result)
  
 "Login Failed - incorrect username or password"

 CVE-2002-2094           This, and others, use ".." attacks and monitor error responses, so there is overlap with directory traversal.
 CVE-2001-1483           Enumeration of valid usernames based on inconsistent responses
 CVE-2001-1528           Account number enumeration via inconsistent responses.
 CVE-2004-2150           User enumeration via discrepancies in error messages.
 CVE-2005-1650           User enumeration via discrepancies in error messages.
 CVE-2004-0294           Bulletin Board displays different error messages when a user exists or not, which makes it easier for remote attackers to identify valid users and conduct a brute force
                         password guessing attack.
 CVE-2004-0243           Operating System, when direct remote login is disabled, displays a different message if the password is correct, which allows remote attackers to guess the password via
                         brute force methods.
 CVE-2002-0514           Product allows remote attackers to determine if a port is being filtered because the response packet TTL is different than the default TTL.
 CVE-2002-0515           Product sets a different TTL when a port is being filtered than when it is not being filtered, which allows remote attackers to identify filtered ports by comparing TTLs.
 CVE-2001-1387           Product may generate different responses than specified by the administrator, possibly leading to an information leak.
 CVE-2004-0778           Version control system allows remote attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files and directories via the -X command for an alternate history file, which causes
                         different error messages to be returned.
 CVE-2004-1428           FTP server generates an error message if the user name does not exist instead of prompting for a password, which allows remote attackers to determine valid usernames.
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Strategy: Separation of Privilege

 Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when
 interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.

 Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers
 should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.

 Phase: Implementation

 Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can
 confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed
 information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.

 If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as
 passwords should never be saved to log files.

 Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

 CWE-940: Improper Verification of Source of a Communication Channel
 
 Weakness ID: 940
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product establishes a communication channel to handle an incoming request that has been initiated by an actor, but it does not properly verify that the request is coming from the expected origin.
 + Extended Description
 When an attacker can successfully establish a communication channel from an untrusted origin, the attacker may be able to gain privileges and access unexpected functionality.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 class of such platforms. The platform is listed along with how frequently the given weakness appears for that instance.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

 Other
                    An attacker can access any functionality that is inadvertently accessible to the source.
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 This Android application will remove a user account when it receives an intent to do so:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter("com.example.RemoveUser");
 MyReceiver receiver = new MyReceiver();
 registerReceiver(receiver, filter);

 public class DeleteReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
 @Override
 public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
 int userID = intent.getIntExtra("userID");
 destroyUserData(userID);
 }
 }

 This application does not check the origin of the intent, thus allowing any malicious application to remove a user. Always check the origin of an intent, or create an allowlist of trusted
 applications using the manifest.xml file.

 Example 2

 These Android and iOS applications intercept URL loading within a WebView and perform special actions if a particular URL scheme is used, thus allowing the Javascript within the WebView to
 communicate with the application:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 // Android
 @Override
 public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url){
 if (url.substring(0,14).equalsIgnoreCase("examplescheme:")){
 if(url.substring(14,25).equalsIgnoreCase("getUserInfo")){
 writeDataToView(view, UserData);
 return false;
 }
 else{
 return true;
 }
 }
 }
 (bad code)
 Example Language: Objective-C 
 // iOS
 -(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType
 {
 NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];
 if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"])
 {
 NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];
 if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"])
 {

 // Make data available back in webview.
 UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
 }
 return NO;
 }
 return YES;
 }

 A call into native code can then be initiated by passing parameters within the URL:

 (attack code)
 Example Language: JavaScript 
 window.location = examplescheme://method?parameter=value

 Because the application does not check the source, a malicious website loaded within this WebView has the same access to the API as a trusted site.

 + Observed Examples

 CVE-2000-1218           DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning
 CVE-2005-0877           DNS server can accept DNS updates from hosts that it did not query, leading to cache poisoning
 CVE-2001-1452           DNS server caches glue records received from non-delegated name servers
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Use a mechanism that can validate the identity of the source, such as a certificate, and validate the integrity of data to ensure that it cannot be modified in transit using an
 Adversary-in-the-Middle (AITM) attack.

 When designing functionality of actions in the URL scheme, consider whether the action should be accessible to all mobile applications, or if an allowlist of applications to interface with is
 appropriate.

 + Memberships
 Section HelpThis MemberOf Relationships table shows additional CWE Categories and Views that reference this weakness as a member. This information is often useful in understanding where a weakness
 fits within the context of external information sources.

 MemberOf        CategoryCategory - a CWE entry that contains a set of other entries that share a common characteristic. 1396    Comprehensive Categorization: Access Control
 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.
 + Notes
 
 Relationship

 While many access control issues involve authenticating the user, this weakness is more about authenticating the actual source of the communication channel itself; there might not be any "user" in
 such cases.

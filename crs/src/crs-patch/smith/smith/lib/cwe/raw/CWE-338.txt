 CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
 
 Weakness ID: 338
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.

 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers.

 + Description
 The product uses a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in a security context, but the PRNG's algorithm is not cryptographically strong.
 + Extended Description
 
 When a non-cryptographic PRNG is used in a cryptographic context, it can expose the cryptography to certain types of attacks.

 Often a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not designed for cryptography. Sometimes a mediocre source of randomness is sufficient or preferable for algorithms that use random numbers. Weak
 generators generally take less processing power and/or do not use the precious, finite, entropy sources on a system. While such PRNGs might have very useful features, these same features could be
 used to break the cryptography.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

                    Technical Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism
 Access Control
                    If a PRNG is used for authentication and authorization, such as a session ID or a seed for generating a cryptographic key, then an attacker may be able to easily
                    guess the ID or cryptographic key and gain access to restricted functionality.
 + Likelihood Of Exploit
 Medium
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 Both of these examples use a statistical PRNG seeded with the current value of the system clock to generate a random number:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 Random random = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());
 int accountID = random.nextInt();
 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 srand(time());
 int randNum = rand();

 The random number functions used in these examples, rand() and Random.nextInt(), are not considered cryptographically strong. An attacker may be able to predict the random numbers generated by these
 functions. Note that these example also exhibit CWE-337 (Predictable Seed in PRNG).

 CVE-2021-3692           PHP framework uses mt_rand() function (Marsenne Twister) when generating tokens
 CVE-2009-3278           Crypto product uses rand() library function to generate a recovery key, making it easier to conduct brute force attacks.
 CVE-2009-3238           Random number generator can repeatedly generate the same value.
 CVE-2009-2367           Web application generates predictable session IDs, allowing session hijacking.
 CVE-2008-0166           SSL library uses a weak random number generator that only generates 65,536 unique keys.
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Implementation

 Use functions or hardware which use a hardware-based random number generation for all crypto. This is the recommended solution. Use CyptGenRandom on Windows, or hw_rand() on Linux.
 + Detection Methods
 Automated Static Analysis

 Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without
 having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with
 "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.
 + Notes
 
 Maintenance

 As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography,
 "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to
 define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other
 scenarios.

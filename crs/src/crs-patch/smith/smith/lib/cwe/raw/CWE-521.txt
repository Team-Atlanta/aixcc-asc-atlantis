 CWE-521: Weak Password Requirements
 
 Weakness ID: 521
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers.

 + Description
 The product does not require that users should have strong passwords, which makes it easier for attackers to compromise user accounts.
 + Extended Description
 Authentication mechanisms often rely on a memorized secret (also known as a password) to provide an assertion of identity for a user of a system. It is therefore important that this password be of
 sufficient complexity and impractical for an adversary to guess. The specific requirements around how complex a password needs to be depends on the type of system being protected. Selecting the
 correct password requirements and enforcing them through implementation are critical to the overall success of the authentication mechanism.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 CVE-2020-4574           key server application does not require strong passwords
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 A product's design should require adherance to an appropriate password policy. Specific password requirements depend strongly on contextual factors, but it is recommended to contain the following
 attributes:

   • Enforcement of a minimum and maximum length
   • Restrictions against password reuse
   • Restrictions against using common passwords
   • Restrictions against using contextual string in the password (e.g., user id, app name)

 Depending on the threat model, the password policy may include several additional attributes.

   • Complex passwords requiring mixed character sets (alpha, numeric, special, mixed case)
       □ Increasing the range of characters makes the password harder to crack and may be appropriate for systems relying on single factor authentication.
       □ Unfortunately, a complex password may be difficult to memorize, encouraging a user to select a short password or to incorrectly manage the password (write it down).
       □ Another disadvantage of this approach is that it often does not result in a significant increases in overal password complexity due to people's predictable usage of various symbols.
   • Large Minimum Length (encouraging passphrases instead of passwords)
       □ Increasing the number of characters makes the password harder to crack and may be appropriate for systems relying on single factor authentication.
       □ A disadvantage of this approach is that selecting a good passphrase is not easy and poor passwords can still be generated. Some prompting may be needed to encourage long un-predictable
         passwords.
   • Randomly Chosen Secrets
       □ Generating a password for the user can help make sure that length and complexity requirements are met, and can result in secure passwords being used.
       □ A disadvantage of this approach is that the resulting password or passpharse may be too difficult to memorize, encouraging them to be written down.
   • Password Expiration
       □ Requiring a periodic password change can reduce the time window that an adversary has to crack a password, while also limiting the damage caused by password exposures at other locations.
       □ Password expiration may be a good mitigating technique when long complex passwords are not desired.

 See NIST 800-63B [REF-1053] for further information on password requirements.

 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Consider a second authentication factor beyond the password, which prevents the password from being a single point of failure. See CWE-308 for further information.
 Phase: Implementation

 Consider implementing a password complexity meter to inform users when a chosen password meets the required attributes.
 + Detection Methods
 Automated Static Analysis

 Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without
 having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with
 "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 Effectiveness: High

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

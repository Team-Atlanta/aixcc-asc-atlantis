 CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
 
 Weakness ID: 346
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities in limited situations requiring careful review (with careful review of mapping notes)
 Abstraction: ClassClass - a weakness that is described in a very abstract fashion, typically independent of any specific language or technology. More specific than a Pillar Weakness, but more general
 than a Base Weakness. Class level weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 1 or 2 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 This Android application will remove a user account when it receives an intent to do so:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter("com.example.RemoveUser");
 MyReceiver receiver = new MyReceiver();
 registerReceiver(receiver, filter);

 public class DeleteReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
 @Override
 public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
 int userID = intent.getIntExtra("userID");
 destroyUserData(userID);
 }
 }

 This application does not check the origin of the intent, thus allowing any malicious application to remove a user. Always check the origin of an intent, or create an allowlist of trusted
 applications using the manifest.xml file.

 Example 2

 These Android and iOS applications intercept URL loading within a WebView and perform special actions if a particular URL scheme is used, thus allowing the Javascript within the WebView to
 communicate with the application:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 // Android
 @Override
 public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url){
 if (url.substring(0,14).equalsIgnoreCase("examplescheme:")){
 if(url.substring(14,25).equalsIgnoreCase("getUserInfo")){
 writeDataToView(view, UserData);
 return false;
 }
 else{
 return true;
 }
 }
 }
 (bad code)
 Example Language: Objective-C 
 // iOS
 -(BOOL) webView:(UIWebView *)exWebView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)exRequest navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)exNavigationType
 {
 NSURL *URL = [exRequest URL];
 if ([[URL scheme] isEqualToString:@"exampleScheme"])
 {
 NSString *functionString = [URL resourceSpecifier];
 if ([functionString hasPrefix:@"specialFunction"])
 {

 // Make data available back in webview.
 UIWebView *webView = [self writeDataToView:[URL query]];
 }
 return NO;
 }
 return YES;
 }

 A call into native code can then be initiated by passing parameters within the URL:

 (attack code)
 Example Language: JavaScript 
 window.location = examplescheme://method?parameter=value

 Because the application does not check the source, a malicious website loaded within this WebView has the same access to the API as a trusted site.

 + Notes
 
 Terminology

 The "Origin Validation Error" term was originally used in a 1995 thesis [REF-324]. Although not formally defined, an issue is considered to be an origin validation error if either (1) "an object
 [accepts] input from an unauthorized subject," or (2) "the system [fails] to properly or completely authenticate a subject." A later section says that an origin validation error can occur when the
 system (1) "does not properly authenticate a user or process" or (2) "does not properly authenticate the shared data or libraries." The only example provided in the thesis (covered by OSVDB:57615)
 involves a setuid program running command-line arguments without dropping privileges. So, this definition (and its examples in the thesis) effectively cover other weaknesses such as CWE-287 (Improper
 Authentication), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), and CWE-250 (Execution with Unnecessary Privileges). There appears to be little usage of this term today, except in the SecurityFocus vulnerability
 database, where the term is used for a variety of issues, including web-browser problems that allow violation of the Same Origin Policy and improper validation of the source of an incoming message.

 CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties
 
 Weakness ID: 552
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product makes files or directories accessible to unauthorized actors, even though they should not be.
 + Extended Description
 
 Web servers, FTP servers, and similar servers may store a set of files underneath a "root" directory that is accessible to the server's users. Applications may store sensitive files underneath this
 root without also using access control to limit which users may request those files, if any. Alternately, an application might package multiple files or directories into an archive file (e.g., ZIP or
 tar), but the application might not exclude sensitive files that are underneath those directories.

 In cloud technologies and containers, this weakness might present itself in the form of misconfigured storage accounts that can be read or written by a public or anonymous user.

 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 The following Azure command updates the settings for a storage account:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Shell 
 az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access true

 However, "Allow Blob Public Access" is set to true, meaning that anonymous/public users can access blobs.

 The command could be modified to disable "Allow Blob Public Access" by setting it to false.

 (good code)
 Example Language: Shell 
 az storage account update --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --allow-blob-public-access false

 Example 2

 The following Google Cloud Storage command gets the settings for a storage account named 'BUCKET_NAME':

 (informative)
 Example Language: Shell 
 gsutil iam get gs://BUCKET_NAME

 Suppose the command returns the following result:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: JSON 
 {
 "bindings":[{
 "members":[
 "projectEditor: PROJECT-ID",
 "projectOwner: PROJECT-ID"
 ],
 "role":"roles/storage.legacyBucketOwner"
 },
 {
 "members":[
 "allUsers",
 "projectViewer: PROJECT-ID"
 ],
 "role":"roles/storage.legacyBucketReader"
 }
 ]
 }

 This result includes the "allUsers" or IAM role added as members, causing this policy configuration to allow public access to cloud storage resources. There would be a similar concern if
 "allAuthenticatedUsers" was present.

 The command could be modified to remove "allUsers" and/or "allAuthenticatedUsers" as follows:

 (good code)
 Example Language: Shell 
 gsutil iam ch -d allUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME
 gsutil iam ch -d allAuthenticatedUsers gs://BUCKET_NAME

 CVE-2005-1835           Data file under web root.
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phases: Implementation; System Configuration; Operation

 When storing data in the cloud (e.g., S3 buckets, Azure blobs, Google Cloud Storage, etc.), use the provider's controls to disable public access.
 + Detection Methods
 Automated Static Analysis

 Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without
 having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect "sources" (origins of input) with
 "sinks" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

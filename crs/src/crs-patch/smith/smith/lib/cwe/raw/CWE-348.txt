 CWE-348: Use of Less Trusted Source
 
 Weakness ID: 348
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product has two different sources of the same data or information, but it uses the source that has less support for verification, is less trusted, or is less resistant to attack.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.
       Scope                                                                                     Impact                                                                                 Likelihood
                    Technical Impact: Bypass Protection Mechanism; Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
 Access Control
                    An attacker could utilize the untrusted data source to bypass protection mechanisms and gain access to sensitive data.
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 This code attempts to limit the access of a page to certain IP Addresses. It checks the 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' header in case an authorized user is sending the request through a proxy.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: PHP 
 $requestingIP = '0.0.0.0';
 if (array_key_exists('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', $_SERVER)) {
 $requestingIP = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];

 else{
 $requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
 }

 if(in_array($requestingIP,$ipAllowlist)){
 generatePage();
 return;
 }
 else{
 echo "You are not authorized to view this page";
 return;
 }

 The 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' header can be user controlled and so should never be trusted. An attacker can falsify the header to gain access to the page.

 This fixed code only trusts the 'REMOTE_ADDR' header and so avoids the issue:

 (good code)
 Example Language: PHP 
 $requestingIP = '0.0.0.0';
 if (array_key_exists('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', $_SERVER)) {
 echo "This application cannot be accessed through a proxy.";
 return;

 else{
 $requestingIP = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
 }
 ...

 Be aware that 'REMOTE_ADDR' can still be spoofed. This may seem useless because the server will send the response to the fake address and not the attacker, but this may still be enough to conduct an
 attack. For example, if the generatePage() function in this code is resource intensive, an attacker could flood the server with fake requests using an authorized IP and consume significant resources.
 This could be a serious DoS attack even though the attacker would never see the page's sensitive content.

 CVE-2001-0860           Product uses IP address provided by a client, instead of obtaining it from the packet headers, allowing easier spoofing.
 CVE-2004-1950           Web product uses the IP address in the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header instead of a server variable that uses the connecting IP address, allowing filter bypass.
 CVE-2001-0908           Product logs IP address specified by the client instead of obtaining it from the packet headers, allowing information hiding.
 CVE-2006-1126           PHP application uses IP address from X-Forwarded-For HTTP header, instead of REMOTE_ADDR.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

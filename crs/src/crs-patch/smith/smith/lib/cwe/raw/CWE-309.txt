 CWE-309: Use of Password System for Primary Authentication
 
 Weakness ID: 309
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.

 Password systems are the simplest and most ubiquitous authentication mechanisms. However, they are subject to such well known attacks,and such frequent compromise that their use in the most
 simple implementation is not practical.

 while the Note provides a typical scenario related to introduction during the given phase.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 In both of these examples, a user is logged in if their given password matches a stored password:

 (bad code)
 Example Language: C 
 unsigned char *check_passwd(char *plaintext) {
 ctext = simple_digest("sha1",plaintext,strlen(plaintext), ... );
 //Login if hash matches stored hash
 if (equal(ctext, secret_password())) {
 login_user();
 }
 }
 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 String plainText = new String(plainTextIn);
 MessageDigest encer = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA");
 encer.update(plainTextIn);
 byte[] digest = password.digest();
 //Login if hash matches stored hash
 if (equal(digest,secret_password())) {
 login_user();
 }

 This code relies exclusively on a password mechanism (CWE-309) using only one factor of authentication (CWE-308). If an attacker can steal or guess a user's password, they are given full access to
 their account. Note this code also uses SHA-1, which is a weak hash (CWE-328). It also does not use a salt (CWE-759).

 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 In order to protect password systems from compromise, the following should be noted:

   • Passwords should be stored safely to prevent insider attack and to ensure that -- if a system is compromised -- the passwords are not retrievable. Due to password reuse, this information may
     be useful in the compromise of other systems these users work with. In order to protect these passwords, they should be stored encrypted, in a non-reversible state, such that the original
     text password cannot be extracted from the stored value.
   • Password aging should be strictly enforced to ensure that passwords do not remain unchanged for long periods of time. The longer a password remains in use, the higher the probability that it
     has been compromised. For this reason, passwords should require refreshing periodically, and users should be informed of the risk of passwords which remain in use for too long.
   • Password strength should be enforced intelligently. Rather than restrict passwords to specific content, or specific length, users should be encouraged to use upper and lower case letters,
     numbers, and symbols in their passwords. The system should also ensure that no passwords are derived from dictionary words.

 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Use a zero-knowledge password protocol, such as SRP.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Ensure that passwords are stored safely and are not reversible.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Implement password aging functionality that requires passwords be changed after a certain point.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Use a mechanism for determining the strength of a password and notify the user of weak password use.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Inform the user of why password protections are in place, how they work to protect data integrity, and why it is important to heed their warnings.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

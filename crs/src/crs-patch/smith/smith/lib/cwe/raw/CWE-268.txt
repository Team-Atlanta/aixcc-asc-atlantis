 CWE-268: Privilege Chaining
 
 Weakness ID: 268
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 Two distinct privileges, roles, capabilities, or rights can be combined in a way that allows an entity to perform unsafe actions that would not be allowed without that combination.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.

                    Technical Impact: Gain Privileges or Assume Identity
 Access Control
                    A user can be given or gain access rights of another user. This can give the user unauthorized access to sensitive information including the access information
                    of another user.
 + Likelihood Of Exploit
 High
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 This code allows someone with the role of "ADMIN" or "OPERATOR" to reset a user's password. The role of "OPERATOR" is intended to have less privileges than an "ADMIN", but still be able to help users
 with small issues such as forgotten passwords.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: Java 
 public enum Roles {
 ADMIN,OPERATOR,USER,GUEST
 }

 public void resetPassword(User requestingUser, User user, String password ){
 if(isAuthenticated(requestingUser)){
 switch(requestingUser.role){
 case GUEST:
 System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");
 break;

 case USER:
 System.out.println("You are not authorized to perform this command");
 break;

 default:
 setPassword(user,password);
 break;
 }
 }

 else{
 System.out.println("You must be logged in to perform this command");
 }
 }

 This code does not check the role of the user whose password is being reset. It is possible for an Operator to gain Admin privileges by resetting the password of an Admin account and taking control
 of that account.

 CVE-2005-1736           Chaining of user rights.
 CVE-2002-1772           Gain certain rights via privilege chaining in alternate channel.
 CVE-2005-1973           Application is allowed to assign extra permissions to itself.
 CVE-2003-0640           "operator" user can overwrite usernames and passwords to gain admin privileges.
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Strategy: Separation of Privilege

 Consider following the principle of separation of privilege. Require multiple conditions to be met before permitting access to a system resource.
 Phases: Architecture and Design; Operation

 Very carefully manage the setting, management, and handling of privileges. Explicitly manage trust zones in the software.
 Phases: Architecture and Design; Operation

 Strategy: Environment Hardening

 Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a
 single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as
 the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.

 There is some conceptual overlap with Unsafe Privilege.

 CWE-212: Improper Removal of Sensitive Information Before Storage or Transfer
 
 Weakness ID: 212
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 The product stores, transfers, or shares a resource that contains sensitive information, but it does not properly remove that information before the product makes the resource available to
 unauthorized actors.
 + Extended Description
 
 Resources that may contain sensitive data include documents, packets, messages, databases, etc. While this data may be useful to an individual user or small set of users who share the resource, it
 may need to be removed before the resource can be shared outside of the trusted group. The process of removal is sometimes called cleansing or scrubbing.

 For example, a product for editing documents might not remove sensitive data such as reviewer comments or the local pathname where the document is stored. Or, a proxy might not remove an internal IP
 address from headers before making an outgoing request to an Internet site.

 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 class of such platforms. The platform is listed along with how frequently the given weakness appears for that instance.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.
       Scope                                                                                     Impact                                                                                 Likelihood
                    Technical Impact: Read Files or Directories; Read Application Data
 Confidentiality
                    Sensitive data may be exposed to an unauthorized actor in another control sphere. This may have a wide range of secondary consequences which will depend on what
                    data is exposed. One possibility is the exposure of system data allowing an attacker to craft a specific, more effective attack.
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 This code either generates a public HTML user information page or a JSON response containing the same user information.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: PHP 

 // API flag, output JSON if set
 $json = $_GET['json']
 $username = $_GET['user']
 if(!$json)
 {
 $record = getUserRecord($username);
 foreach($record as $fieldName => $fieldValue)
 {
 if($fieldName == "email_address") {

 // skip displaying user emails
 continue;
 }
 else{
 writeToHtmlPage($fieldName,$fieldValue);
 }
 }
 }
 else
 {
 $record = getUserRecord($username);
 echo json_encode($record);
 }

 The programmer is careful to not display the user's e-mail address when displaying the public HTML page. However, the e-mail address is not removed from the JSON response, exposing the user's e-mail
 address.

 CVE-2019-3733           Cryptography library does not clear heap memory before release
 CVE-2005-0406           Some image editors modify a JPEG image, but the original EXIF thumbnail image is left intact within the JPEG. (Also an interaction error).
 CVE-2002-0704           NAT feature in firewall leaks internal IP addresses in ICMP error messages.
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Requirements

 Clearly specify which information should be regarded as private or sensitive, and require that the product offers functionality that allows the user to cleanse the sensitive information from the
 resource before it is published or exported to other parties.
 Phase: Architecture and Design

 Strategy: Separation of Privilege

 Compartmentalize the system to have "safe" areas where trust boundaries can be unambiguously drawn. Do not allow sensitive data to go outside of the trust boundary and always be careful when
 interfacing with a compartment outside of the safe area.

 Ensure that appropriate compartmentalization is built into the system design, and the compartmentalization allows for and reinforces privilege separation functionality. Architects and designers
 should rely on the principle of least privilege to decide the appropriate time to use privileges and the time to drop privileges.

 Phase: Implementation

 Strategy: Attack Surface Reduction

 Use naming conventions and strong types to make it easier to spot when sensitive data is being used. When creating structures, objects, or other complex entities, separate the sensitive and
 non-sensitive data as much as possible.

 Effectiveness: Defense in Depth

 Note: This makes it easier to spot places in the code where data is being used that is unencrypted.
 Phase: Implementation

 Avoid errors related to improper resource shutdown or release (CWE-404), which may leave the sensitive data within the resource if it is in an incomplete state.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.
 + Notes
 
 Relationship

 This entry is intended to be different from resultant information leaks, including those that occur from improper buffer initialization and reuse, improper encryption, interaction errors, and
 multiple interpretation errors. This entry could be regarded as a privacy leak, depending on the type of information that is leaked.

 Relationship

 There is a close association between CWE-226 and CWE-212. The difference is partially that of perspective. CWE-226 is geared towards the final stage of the resource lifecycle, in which the resource
 is deleted, eliminated, expired, or otherwise released for reuse. Technically, this involves a transfer to a different control sphere, in which the original contents of the resource are no longer
 relevant. CWE-212, however, is intended for sensitive data in resources that are intentionally shared with others, so they are still active. This distinction is useful from the perspective of the CWE
 research view (CWE-1000).

 Terminology

 The terms "cleansing" and "scrubbing" have multiple uses within computing. In information security, these are used for the removal of sensitive data, but they are also used for the modification of
 incoming/outgoing data so that it conforms to specifications.

 CWE-341: Predictable from Observable State
 
 Weakness ID: 341
 Vulnerability Mapping: ALLOWEDThis CWE ID may be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities
 Abstraction: BaseBase - a weakness that is still mostly independent of a resource or technology, but with sufficient details to provide specific methods for detection and prevention. Base level
 weaknesses typically describe issues in terms of 2 or 3 of the following dimensions: behavior, property, technology, language, and resource.
 View customized information:
 Conceptual For users who are interested in more notional aspects of a weakness. Example: educators, technical writers, and project/program managers. Operational For users who are concerned with the
 practical application and details about the nature of a weakness and how to prevent it from happening. Example: tool developers, security researchers, pen-testers, incident response analysts. Mapping
 Friendly For users who are mapping an issue to CWE/CAPEC IDs, i.e., finding the most appropriate CWE for a specific issue (e.g., a CVE record). Example: tool developers, security researchers. 
 Complete For users who wish to see all available information for the CWE/CAPEC entry. Custom For users who want to customize what details are displayed.

 + Description
 A number or object is predictable based on observations that the attacker can make about the state of the system or network, such as time, process ID, etc.
 + Relationships
 Section HelpThis table shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOf and give insight to similar
 items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that the user may want to explore.

 + Common Consequences
 Section HelpThis table specifies different individual consequences associated with the weakness. The Scope identifies the application security area that is violated, while the Impact describes the
 negative technical impact that arises if an adversary succeeds in exploiting this weakness. The Likelihood provides information about how likely the specific consequence is expected to be seen
 relative to the other consequences in the list. For example, there may be high likelihood that a weakness will be exploited to achieve a certain impact, but a low likelihood that it will be exploited
 to achieve a different impact.
       Scope                                                                                     Impact                                                                                 Likelihood
                    Technical Impact: Varies by Context

 Other              This weakness could be exploited by an attacker in a number ways depending on the context. If a predictable number is used to generate IDs or keys that are used
                    within protection mechanisms, then an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the system. If predictable filenames are used for storing sensitive information,
                    then an attacker might gain access to the system and may be able to gain access to the information in the file.
 + Demonstrative Examples
 
 Example 1

 This code generates a unique random identifier for a user's session.

 (bad code)
 Example Language: PHP 
 function generateSessionID($userID){
 srand($userID);
 return rand();
 }

 Because the seed for the PRNG is always the user's ID, the session ID will always be the same. An attacker could thus predict any user's session ID and potentially hijack the session.

 This example also exhibits a Small Seed Space (CWE-339).

 + Observed Examples
        Reference                                                                                        Description
 CVE-2002-0389           Mail server stores private mail messages with predictable filenames in a world-executable directory, which allows local users to read private mailing list archives.
 CVE-2001-1141           PRNG allows attackers to use the output of small PRNG requests to determine the internal state information, which could be used by attackers to predict future
                         pseudo-random numbers.
 CVE-2000-0335           DNS resolver library uses predictable IDs, which allows a local attacker to spoof DNS query results.
 CVE-2005-1636           MFV. predictable filename and insecure permissions allows file modification to execute SQL queries.
 + Potential Mitigations
 Phase: Implementation

 Increase the entropy used to seed a PRNG.
 Phases: Architecture and Design; Requirements

 Strategy: Libraries or Frameworks

 Use products or modules that conform to FIPS 140-2 [REF-267] to avoid obvious entropy problems. Consult FIPS 140-2 Annex C ("Approved Random Number Generators").
 Phase: Implementation

 Use a PRNG that periodically re-seeds itself using input from high-quality sources, such as hardware devices with high entropy. However, do not re-seed too frequently, or else the entropy source
 might block.

 + Vulnerability Mapping Notes
 Usage: ALLOWED

 (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
 Reason: Acceptable-Use

 Rationale:

 This CWE entry is at the Base level of abstraction, which is a preferred level of abstraction for mapping to the root causes of vulnerabilities.
 Comments:

 Carefully read both the name and description to ensure that this mapping is an appropriate fit. Do not try to 'force' a mapping to a lower-level Base/Variant simply to comply with this preferred
 level of abstraction.
 + Notes
 
 Maintenance

 As of CWE 4.5, terminology related to randomness, entropy, and predictability can vary widely. Within the developer and other communities, "randomness" is used heavily. However, within cryptography,
 "entropy" is distinct, typically implied as a measurement. There are no commonly-used definitions, even within standards documents and cryptography papers. Future versions of CWE will attempt to
 define these terms and, if necessary, distinguish between them in ways that are appropriate for different communities but do not reduce the usability of CWE for mapping, understanding, or other
 scenarios.

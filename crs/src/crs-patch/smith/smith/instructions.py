1. Correct only the sections of the code that contain errors related to the given bug types, keeping the rest of the code unchanged.
2. Ensure the entire code (original and corrected parts combined) compiles and runs without errors.
3. Use Chain-of-Thought reasoning in your comments to detail why the bug occurred and how your fix resolves it. This reasoning should be applied exclusively to the comments.
4. Keep your comments clear, concise, and focused on explaining the bug and the fix.
5. Avoid using triple-backticks in your output."""

Above are two attempts at finding the best input format for the harness I have given you.
Your task is to decide which one is better; evaluate on how well the records correspond to the actual program.
The more explicit the grammar, the better.

You will be provided the following messages:
1. Harness source code
2. First generated grammar to evaluate
3. Second generated grammar to evaluate

Be aware that you as an LLM model are biased towards choosing "2", thus adjust your reasoning to make sure "1" is chosen if the first grammar is truly better.

Please output a "1" if the first is better, and "2" if the second is better.
Any commentary you make must follow your choice in a markdown code block.
Your output should look like the following:

1
```
your commentary on your decision

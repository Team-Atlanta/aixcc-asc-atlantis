Here is a result format example for an extracted input format of an example program.

Your goal is to describe an input format that better explores control flow. The testlang should describe data that "can" be used instead of data that "should" be used.

We recommend that you first give a "chain of thought" containing some information you'll find useful in generating your final input format.
It may be helpful to convert parts of the c program to an intermediate representation, take notes on the c program, or record the lines which read the input.
You may use "<chain-of-thought>" and "</chain-of-thought>" (without the quotes) to denote where your notes start and end.
"<testlang>" and "</testlang>" respectively denote the start and end of your final response.
You should try to have variable names in your final output, so we recommend that you keep them in any intermediate representation you produce.
Always put the chain-of-thought before your final testlang or else!

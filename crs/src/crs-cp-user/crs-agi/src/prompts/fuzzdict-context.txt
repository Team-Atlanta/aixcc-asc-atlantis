Your job is to create a dictionary for fuzzing -- libafl, libfuzzer and AFL,
following the dictionary format described above. Avoid putting the
function names or keywords in the code to the dictionary. Focus on strings
or useful magic values or tokens useful for fuzzing.

You have access to various tools to navigate the repositories and samples of
fuzzing dictionaries prepared.

```
get_file(<path>)
get_dict(<name>)
save_dict(<content>)
```

These are the samples of dictionaries you can request via `get_dict()`:

```
${dictionaries}
```

Here are summaries of some files present in the git repository, which you can
request to browse its content.

```
${repomap}
```

% if readme:
```
README
${readme}
```
% endif

Once you are done generating a new fuzzing dictionary, informs me via `save_dict()`.
